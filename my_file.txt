AN INTERRUPTED NIGHT (from inside flap of dust jacket)

By ISABELLA M. ALDEN (PANSY)

Author of "Ester Ried," "Wise and Otherwise," etc.

In her preface Grace Livingston Hill, a niece of Pansy's, explains
that this tale is based on actual facts told by the woman impersonated
in the story by Mrs. Dunlap. Pansy, now eighty-seven years old and
bed-ridden, found herself unable to complete the preparation of her
story and entrusted the task of putting it into shape to Mrs. Hill,
herself an author of great prominence. In spite of Pansy's advanced
years she still shows the same sparkle and sincerity and understanding
of youth that gave such interest and charm to "Ester Ried" and "Four
Girls at Chautauqua." This story tells of how a young girl comes up
against one of life's most terrible experiences and with the help of
her new-found friend, Mrs. Dunlap, fights her way through a maze of
trickery and deceit to a fuller understanding of life—and romance in
all its beauty.

                         FOREWORD

AS LONG ago as I can remember there was always a radiant being who was
next to my mother and father in my heart, and who seemed to me to be a
sort of a combination of fairy godmother, heroine, and saint. I thought
her the most beautiful, wise, and wonderful person in my world, outside
of my home. I treasured her smiles, copied her ways, and listened
breathlessly to all she had to say, sitting at her feet worshipfully
whenever she was near; ready to run any errand for her, no matter how
far.

I measured other people by her principles and opinions, and always
felt that her word was final. I am afraid I even corrected my beloved
parents sometimes when they failed to state some principle or opinion
as she had done.

When she came on a visit the house seemed glorified because of her
presence; while she remained, life was one long holiday; when she went
away it seemed as if a blight had fallen.

Her eyes were dark and had interesting twinkles in them that children
loved; her hair was long and dark and very heavy, dressed in two wide
braids that were wound round and round her lovely head in smooth coils,
fitting close like a cap, but when it was unbraided and brushed out,
it fell far below her knees and was like a garment folding her about.
How I adored that hair and longed to have hair just like it! How I even
used in secret to tie an old brown veil about my head and let it fall
down my back, and try to see how it would feel to have hair like that.

She had delicate features and a wonderful smile. Nobody else in the
world looked just as lovely as did she. But once I found a picture of
Longfellow's Evangeline in a photograph album, in exquisite classic
profile, and thought it was her likeness. She was like that—if you have
that old faded photograph somewhere in an old album with quaint clasps.
She was wonderful!

And she was young, gracious, and very good to be with.

This radiant creature was known to me by the name of "Auntie Belle,"
though my mother and my grandmother, called her "Isabella!" Just like
that! Even sharply sometimes when they disagreed with her—"Isabella!" I
wondered that they dared. I sometimes resented it.

Later I found that other people had still other names for her. To the
congregation of which her husband was pastor she was known as "Mrs.
Alden." It seemed to me too grownup a name for her and made her appear
more stately and sedate than she really was. I remember resenting it
that these strange people should seem to have rights in her. She was
mine. What were they?

But when a little later my world grew larger, and knowledge increased,
I found that this precious aunt of mine did not belong entirely to us
as I had supposed. She had another world in which she moved and had
her being when she went from us from time to time; or when at certain
hours in the day she shut herself within a room that was sacredly known
as a "study," and wrote for a long time, while we all tried to keep
still; and in this other world of hers she was known as "Pansy." It was
a world that loved and honored her, a world that gave her homage and
flowers, and wrote her letters by the hundreds each week.

It was not long, too, before I had learned to preen myself like a young
peacock because I "belonged" to her, and I am afraid I felt a superior
pity and contempt for the thousands of other children who read her
paper called "The Pansy" which she edited, but who did not "belong"
to her. They could only write letters to her, while I could often be
with her every day, sometimes for weeks, and could talk with her all I
pleased.

As I grew still older and learned to read I devoured her stories
chapter by chapter. Even sometimes page by page as they came hot from
the typewriter; occasionally stealing in for an instant when she left
the study, to snatch the latest page and see what happened next; or to
accost her as her morning's work was done, with: "Oh, have you finished
another chapter?"

And often the whole family would crowd around, leaving their work when
the word went around that the last chapter was finished and it was
going to be read aloud. And now we listened, breathless, as she read,
and made her characters live before us. They were real people to us, as
real as if they lived and breathed before us.

She was at the height of her popularity just then, and the letters that
poured in at every mail were overwhelming. Asking for her autograph
and her photograph, begging for pieces of her best dress to sew into
patchwork; begging for advice how to become a great author; begging for
advice on every possible subject, from how to get the right kind of a
husband, to how to stop biting one's nails.

And she answered them all!

It was a Herculean task. Sometimes she let us help her when she was
very much rushed, but usually she kept her touch on every letter that
went out—and they were thousands.

Then there was the editorship of "The Pansy," a young people's paper
which was responsible for more thousands of letters from the children
who had joined the Pansy Society, and who wrote to her about their
faults and how to give them up, "For Jesus' Sake," which was their
motto.

Sometimes I look back on her long and busy life and marvel what she has
accomplished.

She was a marvelous housekeeper, knowing every dainty detail of her
home to perfection; able to cook anything in the world just a little
better than anybody else—except my mother and her—; able to set fine
stitches in patches and darning that were works of art; able to make
even dishwashing fun!

Sometimes when we were all together for a season, visiting, or during
the winters we spent in Florida and lived together, it fell to her
part and mine to do the dinner dishes together every night, and we
raced, she washing, I wiping and putting away; making a record each
night and trying to beat it the next. And such good, good times as we
had together, my beloved aunt and I, as we worked with a will and left
the kitchen immaculate for the next morning. Oh, she was a wonderful
housekeeper!

Yes, and a marvelous pastor's wife! She took the whole parish into her
life and gave herself to the work. She was not a modern minister's
wife, who only goes to teas and receptions, and plays bridge and
attends to the social end of life, never bothering about the church.
She was the real old-fashioned kind, who made calls on all the
parishioners with her husband, knew every member intimately, cared for
the sick, gathered the young people into her home making both a social
and religious center for them with herself as leader and adviser; grew
intimate with each one personally and led them to Christ; became their
confidante; and loved them all as if they had been her brothers and
sisters. She taught the Primary class—and incidentally the mothers of
the Primary class. She quietly and unobtrusively managed the Missionary
Society and the Ladies' Aid, not always as its executive officer,
often keeping quite in the background. She became the dear friend of
every woman in the church without making any of them jealous. She was
beloved, almost adored of them all.

She was a tender, vigilant, wonderful mother, such a mother as few are
privileged to have, giving without stint of her time and her strength
and her love and her companionship.

Even while she was quite young, when I was a small child she began to
go out into the world, to speak in public, to read her stories, to lead
Primary Sunday School Conferences, and, as I grew older and developed
a delight in drawing, she sometimes took me along to do her blackboard
work for her, at which privilege I swelled with pride. She was much in
demand in those days, and I remember the awe with which I regarded her
as one of the great ones of the earth, who was paid large sums to tell
other people the best ways of teaching, and to read her fascinating
stories. How I loved her and hung upon her every word and smile. How
proud I was to belong to her! And am still.

All these things she did, and yet wrote books! Stories out of real
life, that struck home and showed us to ourselves as God saw us; that
sent us to our knees to talk with Him.

With marvelous skill she searched hearts, especially of the easy-going
Christian, whether minister or layman, young and old, and brought them
awake and alive to their inconsistencies. She wove her stories around
their common, everyday life, till all her characters became alive and
real to those who read. They still live within our memories like people
we have known intimately and dwelt among. Ester Reid and Julia Reid,
the Four Girls at Chautauqua, Mrs. Solomon Smith. I almost expect to
meet some of them in Heaven.

Perhaps she wrote more and better because she was doing so eagerly in
every direction. Her public, her church, her family, her home.

I wish I might paint you a picture of that home as I knew it; of my
home, its counterpart; of the years the two families spent much time
together as one family. The days were one long dream. Hard work? Yes,
but good fellowship. Everybody working together with a common aim, and
joy in the work and the fellowship!

And the evenings! Oh, those evenings, the crown of the days, the time
to which we all looked forward as to a goal when our work was done!
Those evenings are bright spots in my youth. Especially the evenings
of the years we all spent together in Florida, when the sun went
down sharply and the light went velvet black at evening, until the
great tropical moon came out. Those long evenings when the soft dense
darkness shut us in to a cheerful supper table, and, after we had
hustled through the dishes, we all gathered in the big sitting-room
around the open fire for family worship. Yes, we were as old-fashioned
as that! We had family worship both morning and evening. And I am not
of those modern ones who tell such things to scoff at them and say how
sick they got of religion because of it, and lay to that their present
indifference to God and the Bible. I look back to those times as the
most precious, the most beautiful, the most powerful influence that
came into my life. I thank God for a family that worshipped Him morning
and evening and gave me an early knowledge and love for the Bible and
the things of the Kingdom. Either my uncle or my father would conduct
the little service, and often the one or the other of them would say to
my dear aunt: "You read the chapter to-night, Belle," just because she
was such a beautiful reader and we all loved to listen to her. At other
times, we would recite verses, all around, a verse apiece, and then
kneel in a circle for the prayer.

Oh, those prayers of the years that made my life inevitably acquainted
with God, and the Lord Jesus, so that I never could be troubled by the
doubts of to-day, because I know Him, "whom to know is life eternal."
I cannot be thankful enough for those prayers, and that sacred time of
worship every day that brought me into His very Presence.

And then the evening that followed!

We would all get our work, sewing or drawing, painting or knitting,
or embroidery. My father, and my uncle would each take his particular
chair in a shaded corner, and a book would be brought out. It was
always a book that had been selected with great care, usually a story,
now and again a great missionary book but more often a good novel.
And this aunt would usually do the reading. Sometimes my aunt and my
mother took turns reading. They both were remarkable readers, and
knit close in spirit since early childhood. For two, sometimes three
beautiful hours we reveled in the book. Reluctantly, when the word
went forth that it was time to stop, we folded up our work and went to
bed—sometimes pleading for just another chapter—now and then actually
staying up breathless till all hours to finish some great climax. We
always went off to rest with a bright eagerness for the morrow and the
evening, and the story again—or a new one if we had finished one.

So we read the works of George Macdonald—we loved the Scotch, and our
readers knew how to put the burr of the dialect upon their tongues—Ian
Maclaren, Barrie—much of Dickens, some of Scott, Björnson, William Dean
Howells, Jean Ingelow's few matchless novels, Frank Stockton, with his
charming absurdities and a host of other writers whose stories seem to
have become submerged and forgotten in this day of modern literature.
But I look back to those stories as my meeting time with the great
of the earth. How real the Bonnie Brier Bush and all its quaint true
people were! How tender and strong was the Marquis of Lossie and Sir
Gibbie! How I thrilled over the "Men of the Moss Hags," "Ben Hur," "The
Virginian," "Jane Eyre." I mention them at random. It is my ambition
to some day possess in a special set of shelves, every one of those
wonderful stories that thrilled me so when I was young. Oh, don't
try to tell me I would not care for them now! I do. They were real
books, books that do not change because they told of human life as it
is really lived in hearts. They may need to be furnished with a few
electric lights and radios and airplanes and automobiles to make them
up-to-date, but otherwise you will not find them out of tune with life
as it is to-day, except that they are perhaps too clean and wholesome
to be natural to-day.

There were frequent times when this beloved aunt, around whom we all
seemed in those days to center, was called away to deliver an address,
or to conduct a conference, or to furnish an evening's entertainment
in some distant place; but when she returned from one of these trips
we all gathered around to hear her tell her experiences, for we were
always sure of stories. She saw everything, and she knew how to tell
with glowing words about the days she had been away so that she lived
them over again for us. It was almost better than if we had been along
because she knew how to bring out the touch of pathos or beauty or fun,
and her characters were all portraits. It listened like a book.

It was on one of these occasions that she told on her return from
a trip, the story of this book. I remember it as if it were but
yesterday, though the whole thing happened many years ago, for modern
as this story is, the main part of it happened, really happened, to her
personal knowledge, over thirty-five years ago.

It was told to her by a woman who was so well-known all over our
country at that time that if I were to name her you could not help
but remember how active she was in Woman's Suffrage and W. C. T. U.
work, besides several other notable reforms and organizations. She was
a brilliant public speaker, much in demand, and a great worker for
young girls. She recounted this story to my aunt as a recent personal
experience, and gave her permission to use it in a story (after a
suitable interval of time of course, and without the original names.)

The story was written in brief form and appeared several years after
its happening in a periodical as a short serial; but it is now
appearing in book form for the first time. The dear author, after an
interval of several years, during which on account of ill health and a
feeling that her work was done, has taken up her pen once more. But at
what odds! She is now eighty-seven years old and confined to her bed,
the result of a fall and a broken hip. In the intervals of pain she has
been elaborating and preparing this story for book form.

And now, because the manuscript was to have been in the hands of the
publisher long ago, and because pain has held her in its grip for an
unusually long period of weeks lately, leaving her unfit for work for
the present, she has trusted me with the task of putting it into final
shape. This story seems to me peculiarly fitting as a message for this
present time.

I approach the work with a kind of awe upon me that I should be working
on her story!

If, long ago in my childhood, it had been told me that I should ever be
counted worthy to do this, I would not have believed it. Before her I
shall always feel like the little worshipful child I used to be.

I recall a Christmas long ago when I was just beginning to write scraps
of stories myself, with no thought of ever amounting to anything as a
writer. Her gift to me that year was a thousand sheets of typewriter
paper; and in a sweet little note that accompanied it she wished me
success and bade me turn those thousand sheets of paper into as many
dollars.

It was my first real encouragement. The first hint that anybody thought
I ever could write, and I laughed aloud at the utter impossibility
of its ever coming true. But I feel that my first inspiration for
story-telling came from her, and from reading her books in which as a
child I fairly steeped myself.

So I beg the leniency of her readers of to-day as I approach the task
that is set before me. I know I shall have hers. My one hope is that I
shall not in any way mar the message of this true and thrilling tale,
that certainly is needed in this day and generation. I trust that she
may soon be well enough to write once more, herself, another tale as
good if not better.

Let me tell you a secret. I happen to know that this wonderful little
brave aunt of mine is at work on the story of her younger years. She
calls it "Yesterdays." I have had the pleasure of reading a few of
the earlier chapters where she tells of her childhood and her young
womanhood; the quaint things that happened to her; the dear home
in which she lived; the great people of other days whom she knew
intimately and with whom she grew up.

I pray she may be spared with strength to finish her story of her
"Yesterdays," and many more beside.

                       AN INTERRUPTED NIGHT

CHAPTER I

THE train had limped along all the afternoon with engine trouble, and
now at evening the passengers learned that they were two hours behind
schedule and still losing time.

Mrs. Dunlap put away her writing materials and sat up with a sigh to
look about her. It began to look as if she might be going to miss her
connections unless relief from this state of things came soon.

She had just finished correcting the last galley of her new book which
was to come out that fall; she had gone over the notes for her new
addresses she was on her way to make at several appointed places; she
had finished reading her magazine from cover to cover; she had even
written a couple of letters to friends; and here she was with time on
her hands! An almost unheard of thing for this busy woman. Not many
hours of leisure came her way, and when one did, it filled her almost
with dismay at the enforced waste of time.

Off in the west a thread of crimson still lingered on the horizon,
but it soon faded into a line of pale amber and then disappeared. The
lights of the train blared out and shut the travelers into the narrow
confines of the car, and Mary Dunlap leaned back in her seat and fell
to studying her fellow passengers.

The usual mother with many children who had been the usual noisy
nuisance all the afternoon, had subsided into quiet for the time being;
the mother and the littlest baby being asleep, the rest occupied with a
picture book some thoughtful traveler had donated.

The personnel of the car had changed somewhat during the afternoon.
Several people had got out at the stations along the way and others
had come in. Among the latter were the two people who occupied the
seat directly in front of Mary Dunlap, and before she realized it,
she was thoroughly absorbed in studying them, her interest caught by
the singularly pure and lovely outline of the young woman's face, in
profile.

They were apparently a young married couple, though the man was not so
young as the girl, who looked entirely too young to be married yet. As
she studied them she could not help wondering over the girl's choice of
a husband. They did not seem at all well mated. The girl was the far
more attractive of the two.

Mary Dunlap decided that they were newly wed. The man had an air of
proprietorship which she thought could only be explained by that
relation. To the girl everything seemed to be strange and new, but she
did not wear a happy face.

"Poor child!" thought the watcher. "She has just said goodbye to her
mother, I suppose."

Then for a moment, memory carried her swiftly back to the day when she
had been called upon to bid one dear girl the long goodbye.

Still, she reflected, on this girl's face there was unrest—real
anxiety. There were even moments when she fancied that there was actual
fear! What could be the explanation?

The husband had been most attentive, almost oppressively so. Could he
be urging her to some course she did not approve?

"The man looks like a gentleman tyrant!" she told herself. "He will be
certain to have his own way in the end. That poor child might as well
yield first as last."

The call for dinner in the dining car took her away from their vicinity
for a little while, and before she returned they had followed her to
the diner. But later in the evening when they came back to their seats,
she could not help seeing that they were having some kind of a heated
argument, and that the girl was deeply distressed, almost on the verge
of tears, the man alternately vexed and cajoling.

Mary Dunlap was a woman of wide interests and keen insight into
character. She could not help siding with the young wife, and feeling
that the man was in the wrong. He looked like a man who would have his
own way at all costs.

In vain did she tell herself that she was probably all wrong. The
girl might be a spoiled darling who was childishly insisting on some
extravagance which the man, older and wiser, was trying to reason her
out of. But try as she would, she could not make it seem that way. The
man had a selfish sophistication about him that made her distrust him.

Both the young people were well dressed, with that regard to quiet
elegance that showed they had plenty of money, and belonged to what is
known as the higher social class. The trouble could not be about money.

Mary Dunlap turned her eyes away from them at last, resolved to wonder
no more about these strangers who had caught her passing interest. It
was none of her business anyway, what troubled these two. They would
have to settle their own affairs. There was obviously no way in which
she could help them; and perhaps even this kindly observation was a
species of eavesdropping. She would think no more about them.

With her eyes on the dark landscape outside the window, she began to
think about those two hours that the train had lost and to wonder what
she could possibly do about it in case she missed her connection at the
junction. Being a methodical woman, and a careful planner she was not
used to missing her appointments, and it was most annoying to have the
train crawl along this way, and then stop for unexplainable periods.
Nevertheless, there was a certain resignation about her annoyance.
She believed fully that design, not mere chance or Fate determines
our ways, and reorders our plannings sometimes, in accordance with
All-seeing wisdom; and she could not help wondering why her plans had
been put in jeopardy.

For a long time she watched the lights of the little villages go flying
by, for now the train seemed to have taken up a steady, dogged trot,
and rolled along without stopping as if it had made up its mind to get
home sometime.

But when she finally turned her gaze back to the car again she could
see that the two in front of her had not settled their argument
yet. They were not talking much now, but each face was eloquent of
disagreement. The girl's eyes held unshed tears, and her look was
openly anxious. Now and then she cast a pleading look at her companion,
and said a little wistful word, ending in a sigh. The man was still
stubbornly positive, his lips curving in a superior smile of amusement
at the girl's reiterated objections. Again Mary Dunlap began to realize
that her own interest in the affair was unwarrantably eager. She must
stop thinking about these two people or they would pretty soon turn
around suddenly and see her staring at them.

But just at that instant there occurred a happy interruption. The
brakeman came eagerly through the train as one bearing welcome news,
shouting the name of the Junction at last.

Mrs. Dunlap sat up briskly and looked at her watch. Ten minutes past
midnight! Would the other train have waited?

Capably and quickly she straightened her hat, put on her gloves,
buttoned her coat, gathered her hand bag, brief case, and suit case,
and was ready at the door of the car when the train came to a halt.

But a glance at the track on the other side of the station showed that
the train had not waited! The station looked deserted and dirty in the
dim midnight, and her heart sank. Now, why had this had to happen?

Mrs. Dunlap paused for a moment in the doorway of the station as the
disappointed crowds surged from the belated train. They had all more
or less of a discouraged look and she sympathized with them. It was
a new experience to her to be stranded unexpectedly at midnight in a
strange place. Her delay would undoubtedly disappoint many people; but
it certainly was not her fault. She had planned carefully as usual,
and now must send telegrams in various directions to explain her
non-appearance; her first disappointment as a platform speaker after
years of service. She could not possibly reach her first appointment
now in time and the whole schedule would be thrown out. Too bad, but
she must make the best of it.

As she made her way to the telegraph office the man, who had for
several hours occupied the seat in front of her, brushed past her. He
too had probably missed connections and must telegraph. She wondered
where he had left his young wife and wished she might have had a chance
to show her some little kindness. She felt strangely drawn to the girl,
who looked too young to be a wife and seemed so utterly troubled.

"I wonder if they are as much disappointed as I am over the upset of
plans, and if they are disappointing as many people as I am?" she said
to herself, and again a question came to her mind; "I wonder why it was
allowed to happen? I certainly thought I was needed at that meeting
to-morrow morning! They have been planning for it so long! It is so
embarrassing to have to disappoint them this way!"

It very soon became necessary however to give undivided attention to
the question of where she was to spend the remainder of the night. The
Kennard House to which she had been recommended by the ticket agent
proved to be crowded and the gentlemanly and sympathetic clerk could
give her no encouragement.

He shook his head in response to her question: "The Albemarle? No, they
are as badly off as we are. A car just drove away from here with people
who had tried the Albemarle first. It is certainly an unfortunate night
for that express train to be late! The city is overcrowded on account
of the Convention. You are alone, madam? I hardly know what to suggest
to you. We let our very last room go, about three minutes before you
came in, to a couple who were your fellow passengers."

Was that a courteous hint that if she hadn't been so slow in her
movements she might have had their room? Was the fortunate couple the
two who had held her thoughts for hours? If so, she was glad she had
been late; that sad-eyed little wife needed a quiet room for getting
her nerves under control.

Then came another hotel official to exchange a few words in undertone
with the one who was trying to serve her. A moment, then her
sympathetic friend turned to her again.

"Madam, I have just heard that the man who engaged No. 38 for the
night, has changed his mind, and is staying with friends in town. If
you cared to wait in the reception room for a few minutes we could have
it ready for you."

Grateful thanks were of course the only reply to make to this.

As she took up the pen to register Mrs. Dunlap remarked: "It seems
almost foolish to register for the few hours there are left of the
night." But she said it with a genial smile and the friendly air that
made clerks and porters and all who served her, glad to offer a helping
hand.

The name just preceding her own held her attention as probably the one
that belonged to the couple who had so continually interested her that
evening. "R. H. Keller and wife." They were booked for Room 537. That
must be four floors above her own. She wished they had been nearer,
then she might have opportunity to exchange courtesies with that
frightened little bride; if she could only mother her a little, she
would be glad.

The parlor in which she waited looked vast and gloomy in its midnight
dimness and solitude. No not quite solitude, there were other
occupants, a man and woman, probably waiting like herself for a room to
be made ready. Her first impulse was to choose a corner as far removed
from them as space would permit. Instead, she took possession of one
of the couches quite near where they were standing for she suddenly
recognized them as her traveling companions, and her interest in the
girl flamed anew as she caught sight of her face.

What could be troubling that girl! The more she saw of the man's
face the more she distrusted him. Perhaps she imagined it, but it
seemed as though he had recognized her close proximity with a frown!
Nevertheless, she determined not to retreat. What if there should be
a chance just to speak a cheery word to the girl? She tucked herself
among the cushions, drew her coat closely about her, and seemed to
sleep, but she had never felt wider awake. Her nervousness was taking
the form of a premonition.

The man had turned toward his wife. "We may as well be comfortable
while we wait," he said. "It is beastly luck to have to wait at all.
These second class towns never have proper hotel accommodations. Let us
go over to that couch at the other end of the room where the pillows
look less stinted."

The girl looked over at the distant couch then glanced back to the one
where Mrs. Dunlap rested.

"Oh, no," she said, moving nearer to the fireplace. "I am chilly;
I would rather stay here. Suppose you push a couple of those large
rocking chairs up this way?"

"I can make you much more comfortable on the couch," he said, his tone
indicating annoyance. "That fire will not keep you warm, there is
nothing left of it but charred old stumps. Do let me snug you up among
the cushions."

He essayed to pass an arm about her as he spoke, but she drew away from
him with a wan smile as she said:

"I would rather stay here; it seems less lonely to be near a woman. Why
did we trouble about rooms? I think I would just as soon stay where I
am?"

"Standing?" he asked in a tone which to the woman on the couch sounded
sullen.

"No," answered the girl with that pitiful attempt at a smile, "I would
be willing to sit if you would bring up chairs. There cannot be much
longer to wait, I should think. What time did you say we could get a
train?"

When he told her, the response was almost a wail.

"Oh, Rufus! That was not what you said before? Why, that is not until
another day!"

The woman on the couch held herself motionless by a strong effort of
will. This was not the tone of a happy wife! She was certain now that
something was wrong besides a few hours of delay. This was more like
the outbreak of a woman half afraid of the man who was supposed to be
caring for her.

"It is beastly luck," the man said again. "Something is always the
matter on this confounded branch road! If you hadn't been staying in
such an out of the way place, we should have been saved all this.
Still, I don't understand why we should make it any more uncomfortable
than it is. You ought to be resting quietly, instead—"

Her voice interrupted him, louder than it had been before. "I cannot
rest: I cannot! I can only think of my mother's utter dismay and—and
terror when she hears—"

"H-sh!" The man's sibilant whisper was sudden and fierce!

No wonder the girl started, and cried out in fright: "Oh, what is it!"

He bent over her and spoke lower.

"It is nothing at all, my dear, except that you are utterly tired out
and your nerves are on edge. But you must be careful what you say.
That confounded eavesdropper has planted herself as close to us as she
could, and may get the idea from your words that I am a fiend of some
kind. Thank goodness, though, she has gone to sleep, at last! I must
say they are taking an unaccountable time to get that room ready."

"That room!" repeated the still frightened voice. "There are two rooms,
of course?"

"Of course," he repeated hastily, "but I could wait for mine, you know."

"I don't like it," the girl said, quite as if she had not heard him,
"I don't like anything about it! I wish—Oh, Rufus, can't we go on
to-night? Or go somewhere and talk things over and make other plans. I
don't want any room!"

He spoke kindly but with great firmness.

"That is impossible, dear, as you will realize when you think a moment.
All the arrangements are made, and my friend is waiting and will be
there for the next train. There is no other train until morning that
will do us any good. Why can you not be the sensible girl you have been
all the afternoon and let me do the extra planning that this detention
has made necessary? I assure you I can take care of you." As he spoke,
he tried to draw her nearer.

She made a despairing movement away from him and said:

"Oh, I cannot make you understand! I know how strange it seems to you,
but if you could think for a moment of my side of it! Can't you realize
how different it will all be to me when I have the right to be with
you anywhere and always? As it is, I cannot help feeling strangely
alone and—and almost disgraced! I do, Rufus, I cannot help it. Mother
has always been so particular about me; and she would think this that
we are doing was terrible! I know now that she would. Can't we go
somewhere on the cars, and talk it all over? I don't feel so perfectly
strange when we are moving. Hark! Was that one o'clock? And we were to
have been there long before twelve! And you were to telegraph to mother
early in the morning! Oh, this is dreadful!"

He bent toward her and spoke gently. "Daisy, listen, you are making
yourself ill over troubles that do not exist. Everything is all right;
we shall be in by noon, and my friend will meet the train. Meantime in
the early morning I will wire your mother, as we planned; and—"

She interrupted him. "But we don't get in until noon! And what you were
going to say won't be true!"

"Oh, nonsense! Why, my dear, if you were not so tired as to be beyond
reasoning, I could convince you in a very few minutes of the folly of
that! I shall only be anticipating the truth by a very few hours in
order to relieve her anxiety."

"Rufus, I cannot help it. I cannot have our life together begin with
falsehood! It is bad enough as it is. I cannot help being sorry that we
did not wait until mother had a chance to know you better. She is not a
hard or unreasonable woman."

"I see plainly that you do not trust me." He spoke with such bitterness
and sharpness that the listener on the couch who could catch only
portions of the girl's words, felt as though she would like to spring
up that minute and defend her. But the voice rose clearer just then.

"Rufus! How can you say that to me? If I had not trusted you utterly,
would I be here to-night? If you had a mother, you would understand how
perfectly dreadful it is to—"

As she hesitated for words, a hotel official came towards them.

"Are you Mr. R. H. Keller, sir? If so, you are wanted at the office
telephone."

"Confound the fellow!" muttered Keller. Then, in a gentler tone, "Don't
let that frighten you, Daisy. It is a business call that I have been
expecting; but it comes at an inopportune time, of course. I shall be
back in a very few minutes."

Left to herself, the girl walked back and forth in front of the fire,
seeming to catch her breath in convulsive little sobs. She was so near
the couch that Mrs. Dunlap could have put out her hand and touched her.
When that good woman saw a pair of small hands clenched and heard a low
moan, she came suddenly to a sitting posture and in a moment more was
speaking in a low tone.

"Will you forgive me, dear? I am the mother of a precious girl who was
about your age when God called her home. And I miss her so! I cannot
help seeing that you are in trouble. May I not play mother to you for a
little while and try to comfort you?"

But the girl's face at that moment expressed such abject terror, that
she made haste to add:

"There is nothing to be frightened over, dear; this is a quiet,
entirely respectable house, and your husband will be back in a few
moments." It was the probing word that this student of human nature had
resolved should open her way, and it succeeded.

"He is not my husband!" the girl exclaimed. "Not yet," she added
quickly. "We were to have been married as soon as the train reached our
destination; but the train was delayed; we could not go on; and there
were no rooms to be had without this awful waiting! I wish now that we
had not—" She stopped abruptly, then began again.

"I know I must appear very silly indeed to a stranger. But I cannot
seem to help it. And I cannot explain, either, why it should suddenly
seem so perfectly dreadful to me, but it does! I am so used to
traveling with my mother; I cannot get away from the thought of how
perfectly awful it would seem to her if she knew that I—"

The tremulous voice stopped again; and at that moment Mrs. Dunlap felt
that she could almost enjoy shooting the man who had deliberately
planned such a state of things for this frightened child. She passed a
protecting arm about the trembling form and spoke low and tenderly.

"My child, will you trust me and tell me all about it? You remind me of
my own dear daughter; I am sure that you have a precious mother. Does
she know that you expected to be married to-night?"

"No, oh, no! She doesn't dream of such a thing! We couldn't tell her
because she—she is prejudiced against Mr. Keller; he has enemies, we
think, who are trying to injure him because he is a more successful man
than they are, and she—Why, she wasn't even willing to have me walk
out with him, alone! But I thought—I mean I think that when we are
married, and everything is settled forever, we shall be able to make
her understand. It really isn't as though I were a child; I am of age."

At this, the child-woman drew herself up with such a pitiful attempt at
womanhood that Mrs. Dunlap, under happier circumstances, felt sure she
would have asked how many hours it was since the child had attained to
that dignity!

The tremulous voice continued:

"Still, I could not live without my mother; and I do not need to, of
course. As soon as she discovers how truly good and noble Mr. Keller
is, and what a devoted son he is ready to be to her, it will be all
right. Mother has always wanted a son."

A note of appeal had crept into her voice as though she longed to hear
from even this stranger an assurance that all would be well. Mrs.
Dunlap's mother-heart bled for her, and a throb of thankfulness for the
absolute safety of her own daughter thrilled through her. With it came
the determination to do what she could to help this girl, even at the
cost of a possible mistake.

"My child," she said, "I feel that I must tell you something that I
think you ought to know. You are registered at this hotel as 'R. H.
Keller and wife!' And one room—not two—is being made ready for you."



CHAPTER II

FOR a moment Mrs. Dunlap regretted her words. The terror in the
girl's eyes transformed her face; and the low cry she gave was almost
like that of a wounded animal! But she rallied rapidly and said with
eagerness: "Oh, you are mistaken! It is some other person whose name
you have mistaken for his. He would not—why, Rufus could not do such a
thing!"

"My dear child, I am not mistaken." The very quietness of the woman's
voice and manner carried conviction. "The name is R. H. Keller and the
man who is with you here to-night is the one who sat before me with you
yesterday afternoon, and wrote his name as I have told you, just before
I did on the register."

Suddenly the poor girl broke into bitter weeping. "What shall I do!"
she wailed. "Oh, what shall I do! Oh, mother! If I had never gone away
from you! I have killed her! I have killed my mother!"

"No, you haven't!" Mrs. Dunlap's voice had never been quieter, nor
firmer. "You are going home to her this morning, as soon as the train
goes. In a few hours she will have her arms about you. And when you are
really being married, she will stand very near you, and be the first
to kiss you, and call you her darling. You wouldn't disappoint her for
anything! Come with me to my room and wait until train time. There
ought to be one very early in the morning, and I will see you safely to
it."

The girl seized the little hand bag she had dropped, and spoke
hurriedly.

"Where is the room? Oh, quick! Take me to it, will you? That was what
I wanted; a place to be alone and think. I don't know what I can do,
but I must decide; and I must do it before Mr. Keller comes back,
because—oh, will you let me go into your room and lock the door?"

They both turned hurriedly at the sound of footsteps.

It was a porter to say that No. 37 was ready; and never were fleeter
steps than those that followed his lead.

"Oh, hurry!" the girl said breathlessly as they reached the room, and
it was she who turned the key in the lock after the retreating porter.
Then she dropped a limp heap into the nearest chair and cried.

Mrs. Dunlap left her quite to herself and thanked God for the tears.

"What shall I do if he comes and demands to be let in?" the girl asked
suddenly, looking up at her deliverer. "He is so—so masterful; and he
does not look at things as I do. He thinks that a few hours cannot make
any difference. I know how he argued it out with himself that he could
not leave me alone, and that he would shield my name by giving me his
in advance, but I cannot do it, I cannot! And if he comes and insists
upon talking to me, I don't know what will become of me. I don't seem
to be able to make him understand."

"I know, dear; you will be a good girl and go back to your mother. Of
course you cannot do what he wants. This is my room; he will hardly
come to it without my permission. If you think it is necessary to
explain your absence, I will go down to him, if you will let me, and
explain what is necessary."

"Oh, if you will! I mean if you can! He is very determined; and he is
used to having his own way; I cannot think that he will let me—"

She was trembling so violently that she could scarcely speak.

Mrs. Dunlap passed an arm about her and spoke as she might have done to
a frightened child.

"Don't think about that part of it any more; I am not in the least
afraid of him; and I will take care of you! Have you a kimono in this
bag? Let me help you take off your dress, just as your mother would,
and slip the kimono on for a little while. I have been looking at the
time table. You can have almost three hours of quiet; then I will take
you to the train. We can plan all the details afterwards."

"Oh, you are so kind!" murmured the girl.

"I am going downstairs now," the woman said when the girl had submitted
to her ministrations, resisting the suggestion about the bed, but
allowing herself to be propped among pillows in an easy chair. "I will
come back in a little while; or would you rather have this room quite
to yourself? I can be comfortable down on one of the couches, and I
will come for you in ample time for the train."

"No! Oh, no!" the girl said, the look of fear coming into her eyes
again. "Please don't leave me! And yet you must! Would you mind locking
the door and taking the key with you? I cannot help a feeling that—"

"She is afraid of him!" was Mrs. Dunlap's mental comment as she sped
down the hall with the key in her pocket.

On the whole she decided she was rather glad of an opportunity to tell
that man what she thought of him.

She had little time to collect her thoughts, for the subject of them
hurried in soon after she entered the parlor.

There was an ugly frown on his face. Evidently the interview from which
he had just come had irritated him.

He strode to the corner where he had left his companion and stared
about him perplexedly; then turned an angry questioning look upon Mrs.
Dunlap.

"Are you looking for the lady who was here when you left the room?" She
asked pleasantly, determined to be courteous if possible. "She has gone
to my room to get some rest, and asked me to say to you that she is all
right and quite comfortable for the night."

He strode toward her with a glare in his eyes that would have
frightened a less courageous spirit, and spoke in an angry voice: "Who
are you that you presume to interfere in the lady's affairs?" he said
haughtily. "I have a room for her to rest in, and you will oblige me
by telling her that I am waiting for her, and then by minding your own
business."

Mrs. Dunlap had the advantage of this angry man; she was perfectly cool
and calm.

"You are mistaken," she said. "I have the right to interfere, because
the lady has claimed my protection and I am abundantly able and willing
to give it."

"Protection from what!" he thundered.

"From Mr. Keller, I fancy. I supposed, of course, that the lady in
question was your wife, as I had seen you together during the day, and
noticed how you registered. Since she has informed me that she is not;
and, furthermore, that she does not wish to see you again to-night, I
have aided her in carrying out her wishes and must insist on her not
being disturbed."

"Must you indeed! How do you expect to accomplish the task of keeping
me away from the lady who is under my protection, and for whom I alone
am responsible?"

There was menace in his tone and in the glare of his eyes. Mrs. Dunlap
lifted her eyebrows with a gesture of contempt, but she spoke quietly.

"This is absurd, Mr. Keller. I have no wish to make matters more
uncomfortable than is necessary; but of course you are aware that this
is a respectable house. You are here in company with a young woman whom
you registered as your wife; and you ordered a room for yourself and
her; but she says that she is not your wife, and that she does not wish
to see you again to-night. I do not need to remind you how promptly
the proprietor of this house, as well as its guests, would come to
her aid if necessary; nor that policemen and lockups are conveniences
within call. If you compel me to resort to such measures, you will have
yourself to thank."

There was something about Mary Dunlap when she chose to assert herself
that commanded respect. Keller looked into the clear stern eyes of
this woman and realized that he must not go too far. He glared at her,
baffled for an instant, and when she still continued to look steadily
at him, he wheeled and took a few steps away from her. Then, after a
moment, with a sound that was evidently an attempt at a laugh but was
more like a sneer, he turned and came toward her again, trying to speak
lightly:

"You women are too much for me! I may as well take you into my
confidence, as the lady has evidently seen fit to do. It is true that
the formal ceremony which was to have made us man and wife in the eyes
of a curious world has not yet taken place, but the mere formality
is all that is lacking. If it were not for a wrecked engine and this
infernal delay, Mrs. Grundy, whom you are personifying, would have
been able to sleep peacefully. I registered as I had expected to do
after I had reached the station where the clergyman was waiting for
us, because I did not wish to leave the lady alone, in her wearied,
and nervous state, but desired to minister to her comfort, as I would
assuredly have been able to do, had we not been interfered with in this
extraordinary manner. I did not consider it necessary to explain to the
lady that I had anticipated the ceremony by a few hours, in writing her
name as mine, and thus securing a quiet room for her to rest in.

"I may further say that business complications in which a good deal of
money was involved, have made it necessary for me to move with caution
in this entire matter, and for this reason I brought her away with me
quietly, before the outward forms had been complied with; but she came
without coercion of any sort as she will be ready to inform you, if
you explain that you suspect me of being at least an accomplice in a
case of kidnapping! She will tell you also that she is of age, and that
nobody living has a right to object to her taking a journey at any hour
of the day or night with her chosen husband.

"Now, having, I am sure, satisfied the utmost demands of your
curiosity, if you will tell me where to find the lady, I will escort
her to her private sitting-room; and you need not delay your own sleep
any longer. If it will comfort you to know it, I assure you that three
minutes' conversation with my lady, will be sufficient to allay any
fears that you may have succeeded in working up."

This biting sarcasm, partially veiled at times by mock courtesy, was
concluded with what was intended to be a bow of dismissal.

But Mrs. Dunlap was never more quietly determined in her course of
action. Every word that the man had spoken increased her distrust of
him.

"We need not argue," she said. "You have told me nothing that I did
not know before. Let me remind you that the mere formality which is
still lacking to give you the legal right to take care of this woman
is one that decent people still carefully adhere to, and without it
your action to-night has been contrary to law and respectability.
For this reason, no matter what your motive is, or how many private
sitting-rooms you have been able to secure in this overcrowded house,
I can and will protect the young woman from occupying one of them. I
suppose it is hardly necessary to add that if you make the slightest
attempt to see her to-night, or to interfere with her wishes in any
way, I shall not hesitate to take the hotel officials and the police
into my confidence. If you force me to action, you will find that I am
a woman who is very well-known."

During these words the man's face was a study. Fierce indignation,
doubt, perplexity, intense disgust, each struggled for the ascendancy.
But Mrs. Dunlap was about to leave the room. The necessity for
propitiating her in some way forced itself upon him.

"Wait!" he said imperatively. "You do not understand. Is it possible to
make you understand the conditions? Sit down and let me explain just
what has happened, and what I am trying to do."

His manner became suddenly courteous, and he began to talk volubly,
explaining, in more minute detail than the occasion seemed to call for,
the devious ways by which he had reached this point; enlarging upon
his deep affection for the lady of his choice, and his desire to free
her from the narrow and cramped life in which he found her. Her mother
was a commonplace, narrow-minded, exceedingly prejudiced person who
entirely dominated her daughter's life; so that she was in danger of
having no individuality, he said.

Among other proofs of the mother's folly, she had conceived a violent
dislike to himself; and carried her tyranny to such an extent that the
girl was not even allowed to receive a call from him, unless the mother
was present! Matters were in this state, and he was at an utter loss
how to further the daughter's interests, when his good angel, came to
his rescue. The girl went to spend a month with a very intimate friend,
who had married and removed to a town a hundred miles from her home.
Then, quite unexpectedly to himself, business connected with his firm
sent him to that very town. All the rest had followed, almost, he might
say, because of the necessities of the case. He had discovered that
the young lady's affections were as deeply involved as his own, and
that she despaired, as deeply as he did himself, of ever winning her
narrow-minded mother to take their view of things.

Mrs. Dunlap was called upon to assent to the statement that common
people were apt to have violent prejudices for which they could not
account, and were the hardest persons on earth to move. Still, he would
admit that in carrying out the program that followed he had acted upon
sudden impulse rather than premeditated plans.

When the time came for the lady to return home, Providence seemed to
make a way for them to be happy. He need not explain that he had used
no coercion in the matter; the lady realized only too certainly that
her mother stood in the way of her happiness, and that if she had her
way, the daughter would be entirely and forever separated from him.
This, she felt that she could not endure, and they both believed that,
when the irrevocable step was taken, the mother would have a return
to common sense. So, in a moment, one might say, it was all arranged;
indeed it almost arranged itself. He had a friend in the ministry at a
town which was an important junction of the railroad, and to him, he
sent a message planning all the necessary details; but for the horrible
delay because of that disabled engine, everything would have been
complete.

But the delay and confusion and the necessity for their stopping
overnight at a strange hotel had bewildered and frightened the girl,
unused as she was to being alone, or to thinking and planning for
herself. It was the knowledge of that, which had led him to make the
mistake of registering as he did; he could now see that it was a
mistake. He knew there was but one room to be had, and his only thought
had been to secure privacy for her and the right to minister to her
comfort. At the moment there seemed no other way; but he would admit
that it had a bad look to others, who did not understand the situation.
For himself these outward conventions never seemed of paramount
importance so long as one understood one's self. He had not meant to
tell the girl about it, because she, as a matter of course having such
a mother, was terribly trammeled by conventions of all sorts and could
not be made to understand that what was true IN SPIRIT was the same as
truth.

But, he had been foolish; he was ready to admit it. He was even
grateful for her interference, when he came to think carefully,
although he would confess that at first it seemed unpardonable. He had
been a law to himself for so many years, that he knew he did not attach
the same importance to convention that others did, but he must learn
to do so now, for the girl's sake. Of course everything should be as
she wished. He would not for the world go contrary to the lady's real
desires, but it would be necessary for him to see her and rearrange
their program. After he had learned just what she wanted him to do, he
would spend the remainder of the night in long distance communications,
because of course there were explanations that must be made. Having
interested herself in his charge, would she be so kind as to tell her
that he was waiting for her, and must confer with her at once in order
to send his dispatches? He would detain her but a very short time, and
then she could return to the room that had been so kindly placed at her
disposal.

Throughout this elaborate explanation Mrs. Dunlap had sat silent;
her eyes fixed upon the speaker, and her thoughts busy with this new
specimen of human nature.

Not for a single moment did he deceive her into thinking that he was,
in the main, a true man who, because of his love for a pretty girl
and the sudden temptation of opportunity, had been led headlong into
a foolish and dangerous experiment. Not for an instant did she waver
in her determination to keep those two apart, if possible, until the
girl's mother could make a third in their deliberations.

Yet she made no attempt to interrupt the flow of words, and grew
interested in the skill with which he was explaining the unexplainable.

When he paused, with an evident air of having mastered a difficult
situation, she said:

"You are very kind to give me details, although they do not of course
alter the present situation. It is a relief to know that you consider
your course wrong, but I cannot agree with your way of trying to right
it. I have given my word to the lady that she shall not be disturbed
to-night and that she shall take the home-bound train in the morning.
After she is safe at home with her mother and has had time to rally
from the shock that this has evidently been to her, you may be able to
make such plans as neither of you will be ashamed to look back upon;
but she is in no condition to be consulted to-night; and it may help
you to realize, what I feel quite sure of, that she has had her lesson,
and that any future plans you may care to make must take her mother
into full consideration. You will pardon the suggestion that you must
have had many more years than she, in which to learn wisdom; she is but
eighteen I believe, while you—"

She paused significantly, but the man whom she judged to be not less
than thirty-five at least, was speechless with amazement and dismay. He
had staked much and expected to win.

She turned and left him before he could think of any excuse to detain
her longer.



CHAPTER III

THE remainder of the night was as unique in its way as its earlier
hours had been. On Mary Dunlap's return to her room she found the girl
was more composed, and able to talk quietly.

"I have had time to think it all out," she said, when Mrs. Dunlap had
told what she meant to tell. "Mr. Keller does not understand; his
mother died when he was a child and he brought himself up, in a way. He
has been a law to himself and to others for so long that he just goes
ahead and does what seems best to him. I am sure he meant right. Even
that strange part about registering," her face flushed as she spoke,
"I can see it was done for my sake. I am so lacking in self-reliance
and had been so nervous all day that he felt he could not trust me
alone, and took that way of caring for me. But it is no wonder that I
am nervous, for I have been doing wrong all day! I did not know it; I
thought because I was of age I had a right to decide for myself but
I realize that there is a higher law than just a legal one, and I am
going home to mother! I am afraid she will feel that she can never
trust me out of her sight again, and I do not deserve to be trusted.

"It is all very plain to me now, what I ought to do. I shall write to
Mr. Keller and tell him that we must wait, and give my mother time to
know him, and to learn what a truly noble man he is. Then we must try
by all honorable means to win her consent to our marriage. I will not
cannot be married till my mother feels right about it."

"I think that sounds like a very wise decision," said Mary Dunlap with
relief in her voice. "That is what mothers were given for, to help in
grave decisions. They seem to have a sort of God-given intuition about
the great critical things of life. Remember that if you do not succeed
in winning her over, such a mother, as a girl like you must have,
surely must have wise reasons for objecting—"

"Oh, I'm sure we will succeed," interrupted the girl's voice anxiously.
"My mother wants nothing in this world so much as my happiness. But if
we cannot, after a reasonable time, convince her that he is worthy of
her trust, why then we must just be married, without her consent. I
have my own life to live—" she drew herself up proudly with a pitiful
assumption of dignity—"I cannot afford to spoil my life and his for the
sake of a cruel prejudice."

This last was so manifestly an echo from Mr. Keller's philosophy that
the listener said not a word, in response, and the eager voice went on.

"But we must do it honestly; there shall be no slipping away as though
we were ashamed! I cannot understand how I could have done such a
thing! Doesn't it seem strange that I should know now just what to do,
when this morning I did not at all! And so, dear friend—you will be my
friend always, will you not? And mother will never know how to thank
you enough for what you have done for me to-night! If you will put me
on the train in the morning, as you said, I will go directly home; no
matter how many broken engines hinder."

Mrs. Dunlap tried by all conceivable devices to induce her charge to
get some sleep. She rang for a porter and made careful arrangements
for the early train; planning the minutest details with a view to
convincing the girl that she might be trusted. But there was no sleep
to be had for either of them. Her charge was docile enough; she lay
down obediently and closed her eyes; but she started at every sound,
and imagined sounds that were not; frequently, after a few minutes
of silence, she would break into eager explanations of some of Mr.
Keller's movements, with a view to placing him in the best possible
light.

"What is his business?" Mrs. Dunlap asked; deciding, after fruitless
effort that to humor the child's restlessness was perhaps the better
way.

"He is—I—don't know—!"

The sentence began eagerly, then a pause, and the half bewildered
conclusion.

"He has to travel a great deal," she added; "belongs to a firm, you
know; but I find that I do not know what the firm is; it seems strange
that I never thought to ask him!"

"Is his home in the West?"

"Yes—no, he is there winters; summers he is East somewhere. I don't
remember which city he calls 'home'; he is in New York a great deal. He
really hasn't much home I presume; an unmarried man, whose parents are
dead; it must be very dreary."

"Poor innocent child!" was Mrs. Dunlap's mental comment. "She really
knows no more about the man than I do; I'm afraid not so much! For all
that she could prove, he might be an adventurer of the sort that is
careful not to have a settled home."

But all that she put into words was an earnest admonition to the girl
to try to rest. For herself, she did not mean to sleep; every nerve was
on the alert for a possible invasion. Who could be sure of what that
defeated plotter might attempt?

But the night passed without further incident and early morning found
the two at the telegraph office, from which presently two messages sped
on their way. One read:

   "Delayed by disabled engine. Coming on No. 2. All safe. Daisy."

It had taken nearly half an hour to compose this message
satisfactorily. The other read:

   "Must fail you for Wednesday. Will give you Thursday instead,
   if desired. Wire me at Winfield. Mary Dunlap."

Mrs. Dunlap had decided that the personal deposit of this young girl at
her mother's door was more important than any other "woman's work" that
she could do that day although she did not know that the man she had
foiled was already seated in the smoker of the early train, waiting for
her to disappear. She utterly distrusted him, and felt instinctively
that he would watch his opportunity.

It was to the girl's great astonishment that, having established her
charge in comfort, Mrs. Dunlap prepared to seat herself in the opposite
chair.

"Oh, are you really going this way?" said the unsuspecting child. "What
made me think that you were going farther West? How far do you go? To
Winfield? Why, that is just beyond my station! How lovely! You will
stop and see mother and let her thank you herself, won't you?"

But Mrs. Dunlap had decided that she would not. If the man were only a
fool, and not a confirmed villain, and the child's heart was bound up
in him, it were better for all concerned that her prejudices, as well
as her knowledge of that tragic night, should never reach the mother's
ears.

When the journey was over and they drove to the girl's home, she waited
only to clasp hands with the sweet-faced, low-voiced, grateful woman,
into whose eager arms Daisy flung herself, and to decline the pressing
invitation to the home that wanted to shower kindnesses upon her; then
sped on to Winfield. Arrived in Winfield, Mary Dunlap's sole errand was
to read a telegram she found awaiting her, send another, and take the
first train back West.

On the fourth morning following, she opened her eyes in a beautiful
room in one of the elegant homes of a New York city suburb. It was
still early, and she lay quiet for a few minutes, feasting her
beauty-loving eyes on the evidences of abundant means and highly
cultured taste spread lavishly about her. She had been too weary the
night before to take in any details, except a bed. Mrs. Dunlap was
accustomed to the position of honored guest in all sorts of homes.
She could accommodate herself to the furnishings of the plainest home
with a grace that was one of her charms; but she confessed to her very
intimate friends that when "the lines fell to her in pleasant places,"
it always stirred an extra note of thanksgiving in her heart. There was
certainly nothing lacking here; nothing to offend the most fastidious
taste, or for the most exacting to desire.

The days and nights just past had been strenuous ones to this always
industrious woman. There had been first the rapid journey involving
another failure in appointment, for this woman who prided herself
on never failing; an equally rapid return to the East, reaching her
next engagement just in time; then two hours by rail to her evening
appointment; and here she was taking breath in a lovely room with a
whole day of rest before she had to start again!

She was in no haste to move. Her thoughtful hostess had urged her not
to hasten down in the morning. "We do not breakfast until nine, and not
always then if the head of the house is absent; as he is now I am sorry
to say. I have always wanted him to meet you. Dear Mrs. Dunlap, I may
as well confess that I am awfully proud of my husband!" The sentence
had closed with an apologetic laugh.

What a transparent little lady her hostess was! She ought to be very
happy, with a husband of whom she was "awfully" proud, a beautiful home
crowded with all the luxuries that wealth could produce, and probably
not a care in the world!

Mary Dunlap could not resist a little sigh of pity for herself; she
was a lonely woman. Her husband and home and child all gone from her.
She, too, had been "proud" of her husband with abundant reason; and her
beautiful girl. But her girl was safe. The terrors of this awful world
could not touch her.

She thought of "Daisy," and shuddered for the narrowness of her escape.
Had she escaped? Would that wretch try to find her again? Perhaps she
had not done her whole duty. She ought to have warned the mother. What
were mothers about, to be so careless? But for that disabled engine,
the child would have gone straight on her dangerous way!

Very slowly at last she went about the business of dressing, enjoying
luxuries of the toilet not found ordinarily in hotels or boarding
houses, and reveling in costly trifles lavishly furnished. Even in the
halls she came upon treasures of art to study over, and as she lingered
before them, she told herself with a half wistful smile that she must
have a care lest she become envious of Mrs. Oliver.

Then she fell to moralizing. Was it probable that her hostess had her
heart's desire in all things? It looked so.

There were two daughters, she had heard, who were their mother's joy
and pride also. Certainly the outward appearance of the home left
nothing to wish for. In such an atmosphere it was hardly possible
to avoid thinking of sharply contrasted lives. Not her own, though
the contrast there was marked enough. Still, she lived a busy and,
she believed, a useful life, and was happy in her work. But she knew
women—many of them—to whom the word "happy" could not be applied; women
with warped, stunted, yes—wrecked lives!

Instantly with that word, her thoughts flew again to "Daisy," the
acquaintance of a day, who had been so close to wreckage and who
had made a permanent place for herself in this mother-heart. That
awful man! Would she ever meet him again? If so, what would happen!
What if she should meet him under circumstances that would compel
her acknowledgement of him as an acquaintance? For instance, what if
he should, after all, become Daisy's husband! She recoiled from the
thought as she might have done from a blow; yet one could not be sure;
the child had given herself unreservedly to him, unworthy of her as he
seemed. Perhaps her love would redeem his life! Ought she not to hope
so? Yet her very soul revolted from it!

Next, she was in the lower hall looking over the morning mail,
gathering from it letters and telegrams for herself; and her hostess
was coming forward to meet her, in the most charming of house gowns,
with a face as bright as the morning. She was voluble in her hope that
the night had been restful, and that her guest could give them the
entire day.

"It is so delightful that Mr. Oliver is at home to enjoy you; I had
no hope of such a thing. He came home unexpectedly on a later train
than yours. He had started on a very long business trip, expecting to
be gone for several months. Then, one of those unaccountable business
changes came up—I never pretend to understand business—and he came
back. The children and I held a jubilee over his arrival. You can't
think what a trial it is to have him away so much! Fully half his time
is spent in the West, or the South, or somewhere!"

At that moment the dining-room door opened, and the voluble voice
flowed on. "Oh, Ralph, are you down already? Mrs. Dunlap, let me
present my husband, Mr. Oliver."

And Mary Dunlap was face to face with the man she knew as "R. H.
Keller"!

How they got through with that awful breakfast hour Mrs. Dunlap was
never afterwards quite certain. She knew she had a sudden frightened
feeling that she must not wreck that poor woman's home not yet, at
least. She must take time and think what to do. She must keep up some
form of appearances; she must seem to receive the man as her host;
she must not say anything about the Kennard House or the interrupted
journey, or the disabled engine. What could she say? She knew that she
did not address him, directly, and that his wife did more than her full
share of the talking, for which she mentally blessed her.

Once the wife said: "Why, Ralph, what on earth is the matter? You are
as white as a ghost! Don't you feel well? I don't think you ought to
start again to-night; I don't really."

He put her off with a pleasantry of some sort; asked if the girls had
gone to school already, and gave careful attention to serving the guest.

Somehow the ordeal was lived through.

As they arose from the table Mrs. Oliver issued her directions.

"Now, Ralph, I want you to take Mrs. Dunlap to the library and
entertain her for the next half hour. I have a tiresome committee
meeting of the utmost importance that demands my personal attention;
but I am going to dismiss it in half an hour, and then we'll make plans
for the day. It is delightful to be able to have you both for all day!"

There was no attempt on the part of either to reply. Silently the host
threw open the door of his well-equipped library, which under other
circumstances Mrs. Dunlap would have found pleasure in exploring, and
silently motioned her to a seat. While she sank among the cushions of
a luxurious chair, he carefully closed the door; then, crossing to the
doors leading to the music room, he closed them also. He seated himself
but a few feet from her and spoke in the tone he had used when he asked
her why she had presumed to interfere with him.

"Well. I am at your mercy! What do you propose to do?" That was what he
said.

She looked steadily at him, but was speechless.

After waiting a moment he added: "I did not interfere with what you
saw fit to do, by word or glance, although you must know that I could
have done so had I seen fit. Why you have been silent thus far and have
chosen to accept my wife's hospitality, I am at a loss to understand;
unless it is in the interests of a still greater sensation. Is it your
intention to tell me how you mean to proceed in the blasting of my
home, or do you still prefer to work in the dark?"

The man was actually arraigning her! Or was this merely a game of
bluff? What kind of woman did he take her to be! The indignant blood
surged in her veins; she got out of the comfortable chair and took an
uncompromising straight-backed one directly opposite his.

"Are you so accustomed to 'working in the dark' that you fancy others
are doing it also?" she said, fixing him with her clear gaze. "Did you
suppose that I had the slightest idea of meeting you when I came to
this house and accepted its hospitality?"

His face changed suddenly and he bent forward as if to lessen the
distance between them, speaking eagerly.

"Have I been mistaken in you? Mrs. Dunlap, on your honor as a woman,
did you not find out my name somewhere and follow me, to this house
with my discomfiture in view?"

"I certainly did not!" she answered indignantly. "Do you think I would
have slept under your roof knowingly? I have not yet awakened from the
daze of horror into which the sight of you threw me."

"Then I beg your pardon," he said with evident relief. "I have wronged
you. Now I will literally and gratefully, if you will permit the word,
throw myself on your mercy. You see what my home is, and my family I
have children. You have been given some idea of what they think of me,
and what I am in the main; an attentive husband and father, doing his
utmost for the comfort of his home. You happen to have seen me under
damning conditions, and without understanding the—the temptations. And
now you have it in your power to ruin this home and blast the future
of young and trusting lives; as well as break a woman's heart! Or,
you have it in your power to save us all! You are a merciful woman, a
philanthropist, my wife tells me, I believe you will save us. You see I
am not asking justice, but pleading for mercy."

He had not moved her by a hair's breadth unless it were to increase her
indignation. Her voice was steady and cold.

"Did you not have it in your power to ruin two homes, one of them
widowed and fatherless, and did you spare them? You dare to talk to me
of 'mercy' and 'philanthropy' when you were not willing to shelter even
your own fireside!"

He dropped his eyes from her face and worked nervously with the paper
cutter he held.

"You do not understand," he said. "It will be difficult to make you
understand! You are one who makes no allowance for a man's temptations."

She flashed a look of scorn at him, but he did not look at her, and
went on more quickly.

"I don't know what devil possessed me to do as I did that night. I did
not plan it, deliberately. I did not plan any of it, it just happened.
A fellow, whom we called 'the parson' in college, because he always
took those parts in the plays, had just written me about a mock wedding
at which he had officiated, and he was within easy reach. The truth is
the girl tempted me!"

He caught the flash in her eyes just then, and heard and understood her
words:

"Oh, of course; 'The woman beguiled me'!"

He pulled himself together. "I simply mean that she was—was—very
bewildering, and I—" He was finding it hard to explain. He wished that
the woman would look at the floor; or at something, instead of at him!

"I am going to be entirely frank with you," he said at last, with a
sudden assumption of friendliness. "My wife is—we are—not congenial,
not well mated; our marriage was a sort of mockery, from the first, one
of convenience, one may say, on my part. I thought I ought to marry her
because she cared for me, and because well, for family reasons. I never
really loved with my whole soul any woman until I met Daisy; after I
knew her, what seemed really wrong to me, was to continue the travesty
of home life when I knew that home, to me, meant her. I intended, I
fully intended, as soon as the necessary preliminaries could be managed
to set myself free, in order to possess her.

"But I did not plan to injure her reputation in any way, nor indeed
anyone's reputation. Divorces are common enough I am sure. The idea
of running away with Daisy for a few weeks came upon me, as I said,
suddenly. I was going West, very far West, and she was returning home,
when I met her on the train. It was impossible for me not to see how
easily we could enjoy a delightful season together, at some pleasant
resort where neither of us was known—merely as good friends you
understand. The marriage ceremony was to be a temporary convenience to
quiet her nervousness, to be explained afterwards as a good joke. On my
honor I meant nothing else."

He came to a sudden pause, for Mary Dunlap had risen, her face white
with righteous indignation.

"I must interrupt you," she said. "I fail to see why you should
disgrace yourself and me by exposing such details, or attempting to
gloss over your sin. If you think to win sympathy thereby, you must
have a strange idea of women! You to defile that sacred word 'love'
in such connection! Why even a wild beast knows that love means
protection, means sacrifice of self for the sake of the object loved!
But you loved this child only enough to practice upon her the most
cruel deception a man can offer to a woman, to blight her future, and
bring despair to her family, for the sake of gratifying for a few
weeks, your passion for her society!

"It is folly to suppose that you did not know what you were doing! You
are neither a fool, nor a lunatic. Why do you want to grovel before me
by exposing that whole vile plot? It seems amazing that you can have
so soon forgotten what you said to me that night at the hotel; and
how awfully your words and your position contradict those statements!
Before I saw you in this house this morning, as the husband of another
woman, I supposed you were a half-way decent villain, who had tried to
run away with and marry the girl he fancied he loved."

He too had risen. He trembled visibly and he was white to his lips, but
he tried to speak with dignity.

"I have made a mistake," he said. "I see I cannot make you understand.
But I am ready to grovel still, and beg your mercy. I have not ruined
her; she is free from me forever; and I am asking you to have pity on
my wife and children. And since no harm can come to anyone by your
silence, to spare my family. I am ready to give you my word of honor
that I will never see the girl again, never attempt to communicate with
her in any way."

Mrs. Dunlap's immediate response to this, brought a scarlet flush over
his face and set the blood humming in his ears: "Your word of honor!"

But he was in real terror now; he had neither cowed nor deceived
this woman. No sentimental twaddle about uncongenial marriages and
soul-love, had done other than deepen her disgust.

He was also realizing something of the power that such a woman would
have, once she exerted it, against him; and she was his wife's friend!
Yet he had an instinct that he could trust her. He must beg.

"I deserve that," he said, after a breathless moment. "Well then, I
will swear by all that you hold sacred never to see or try to hear from
that girl again. Will you keep my secret?"

For a full minute, which must have seemed an hour to the waiting man,
there was silence in that room. Then Mary Dunlap spoke.

"With conditions, yes; but you must do more than that. There are
other girls in the world. I do not ask you to give me your pledged
word because—" There was a single expressive gesture of her hand that
consigned any "pledged" word of his to the lowest level of contempt,
and she left it to complete the sentence.

"But you have chosen to speak of me as a philanthropist. Perhaps you
are aware that my life is given to the protection of young innocent
girls who are in danger because of such men as you; and you may
possibly understand what mighty forces I can call to my aid anywhere
in the civilized world, if occasion requires. In view of this, for the
sake of your wife and daughters, so long as you keep your life steadily
within the law that governs respectable men, and hold yourself from
insulting, by your attentions, not only the girl you tried to ruin, but
every other girl and woman on God's earth, I will agree to keep silence
to all but the one whose affections you have stolen, and her mother!
These two shall know all that I do; the girl, that she may learn to
turn from the thought of you with loathing, and the mother that she may
guard her child with jealous care from men like you.

"Then, I must remind you that the same forces for righteousness that
stand ready to help me, are as able to keep me informed as to how
steadily you adhere to the terms I have made. On these grounds do you
wish mercy from me?"

The man was looking steadily at her now. Man of the world as he was,
hypocrite as the life he lived had trained him to be, accustomed to
sneering at women, to flirting with women, to boasting within himself
that he could lead them captive at his will, he looked at this woman
whose hair was silvering, and felt that she could, and would, keep her
word! For a long minute, he gazed at her, as one compelled to consider
her, then bowed silently, and dropped his gaze to the floor.

There were quick steps in the hall, an eager hand on the door-knob, and
Mrs. Oliver fluttered in.

"It was a long half hour, wasn't it?" she began. "Those women would
talk! I thought I should never get away from them. Goodness! What is
the matter with you two? You look as though you were posing for high
tragedy. You haven't quarreled, have you?"

Mary Dunlap arose to the occasion.

"My dear Mrs. Oliver, I have decided that I shall have to change my
plans, and start for Albany by the noon train to-day. There is a matter
I have concluded must have my immediate attention."

Mrs. Oliver was voluble with regrets. Such a disappointment! She
had been planning for this one day for so long! And Mr. Oliver was
unexpectedly here to enjoy it with them! So sorry especially to have
her miss seeing their new Y. W. building that had been planned "in
exact accordance with your own ideas, dear Mrs. Dunlap, and it is
simply perfect. Do, Ralph, tell her how sorry you are not to be able to
show her through it."

Thus urged, Mr. Oliver succeeded in finding voice to say: "Mrs. Dunlap
understands, I am sure, better than I could tell her, how ready I am to
do her bidding."

Mrs. Dunlap got away by the noon train and took the night-express
for the West, canceling all her engagements for the week; she had
more important work to look after. Not telegrams, nor long distance
telephones, nor even carefully written letters could serve her now. She
must go in person to try to explain, as best she might, to that dear
girl who was waiting at home to hear from one to whom she had given her
trust, to prove him to her mother as "good and noble!"

As she sped westward that afternoon the good woman prayed that she
might be able to help save that sweet, periled life.



CHAPTER IV

MRS. SHELDON and her daughter Daisy were occupying easy chairs in their
pleasant living-room, surrounded by all possible evidences of home
comforts, and luxuries. But even a passing glance at the two faces
would have suggested unrest. The mother's face looked worn, and her
eyes were anxious; while the daughter's eyes were tense with excitement.

"Daisy dear," began Mrs. Sheldon, and was interrupted:

"Please, Mother, won't you call me 'Marguerite'?"

A look of pain flushed the mother's face but she spoke quietly.

"Why, daughter, you know I nearly always say 'Daisy.'"

"I know you do; but I—I don't like it to-night; I—Mother, I just can't
bear the sound of it! That's the only explanation I can give."

Unshed tears were in the mother's eyes. "I will try to remember," she
said, her voice low and tremulous. "But you are my 'Daisy' you know;
all I have left in this world; and your father loved that name."

Daisy with a sudden movement flung herself on the arm of the great easy
chair and hid her face in her mother's neck; when she tried to talk her
voice choked with sobs.

"Oh, Mother, do please try to understand; you know what Father was to
me, and you surely know that I love you with all my soul. If I hadn't,
I—"

But the convulsive sobs came again, and she once more hid her face,
while the mother's arms clasped her tenderly. A few minutes passed,
then the girl sat erect and tried again.

"Mother dear, forgive me." As she spoke, she slipped to the footstool
beside her mother's chair. "I didn't mean to worry you. I don't often
go to pieces in this way, do I? But—you can't understand what I am
going through! It seems so strange not to hear a word after almost five
days! I thought I should certainly get a telegram, at least! Mamma, I
didn't mean that about my name; at least not in the way it must have
sounded. I shall get over that feeling, of course; but you see he did
not know me by any other name; and when you used it, for a second it
almost seemed as though I could hear his voice, and oh, Mother, I
couldn't bear it! I spoke right out, before I thought.

"Mother, it seems as though you must understand what I mean! Don't you
know you told me about how you loved Father so very much even right at
the first? That is the way I feel about Rufus. Mother, I love him with
all my soul, and I always shall! I never before knew what love meant,
that kind of love, I mean and I can't tell you how it almost kills me
to think that you don't believe in him!

"But you know you have hardly seen him. You have just let yourself be
prejudiced by those horrid women who gossiped about him; just because
he, was polite and helpful to those little flappers who were traveling
alone; he showed them the same attention that any gentleman would. But
I don't blame you, Mother dear; I suppose it is natural for mothers to
feel so; when you never have had a chance to find out for yourself what
a wonderful man he is. Besides, think how I helped it along!

"Why, mother, when I think of the way I let that awful Mrs. Dunlap, a
perfect stranger, manage me so that I almost insulted him, it makes me
feel as though I were going insane! Oh, I hope I shall never see or
hear of her again! How could I let her make me treat him so! I don't
see how he can ever forgive me! O, Mother! How can I live any longer! I
wish I could die to-night!"

It was just then that the sound of the door bell pealed through the
quiet house. The sound had instant effect on the nerves of the half
insane girl. She sprang up quickly, evidently making a supreme effort
at self-control, and spoke in a more natural tone.

"I'm afraid that's Nelson! I entirely forgot that he was to come
to-night if he got back in time, to tell me how the vote went; as if I
cared how they voted!"

With this last word, her voice had returned to bitter sarcasm; but
after a moment she continued more quietly.

"Will you see him, Mother, and tell him tell him anything you like?
I simply cannot talk with him to-night; nor with anybody else. Oh,
Mother, kiss me and let me run away!"

By this time the poor mother had no words to offer about anything.
She put her arms around her daughter, kissed her tenderly and opened
the door for her to escape by way of the back hall, just as the maid
appeared at the sitting-room doorway, card tray in hand.

"For Miss Daisy, ma'am. Has she gone upstairs? Shall I take it up to
her room?"

"No," said the weary, faithful mother. "Daisy does not feel able to see
callers to-night; I'll attend to it."

She held out her hand for the card and read on it:

   "Mrs. J. C. Dunlap, Albany."

"Dunlap!" Over that name the face of the mother flushed, then paled.

That was the name of the woman who had watched over her darling with
such wise and patient care, and brought her safely home! Could it
possibly be the same woman who was waiting in the parlor! If so, how
could she talk with her just now? She felt completely exhausted. Still,
Daisy certainly must not be called. She reminded herself that the name
Dunlap was common enough, even though she did not happen to recall it
among her acquaintances. It really was not at all probable that a woman
who lived hundreds of miles away should suddenly appear late in the
evening to make a call!

At last she crossed the hall and opened the living-room door. One
glance sufficed; the woman who arose at her entrance was the same one
who had kissed Daisy goodbye with unmistakable tenderness only a few
days before!

"I'm afraid I have startled you," said Mary Dunlap moving forward; for
Daisy's mother had paused suddenly the moment she caught sight of her
caller, and her pale face was expressive of pain. "Of course you did
not expect to see me so soon again, but I—it became my duty to return
West sooner than I had planned. I hope I may see your daughter for a
few minutes? There is a—I have heard of—something connected with our
journey together, that she, perhaps, ought to be told."

It was a very hesitating sentence; the speaker's tone and manner
suggested embarrassing uncertainty as to just what she should do next.
Something helped the mother to self-control and decision. Whatever that
woman thought she ought to tell Daisy ought to be told! She believed in
her! She might be mistaken in judgment, of course; unduly alarmed about
a small matter; all people were liable to mistakes, occasionally. But
she was sincere! Of that, Mrs. Sheldon felt absolutely sure; and what
she had to say might help to clear away some anxieties. She held out
her hand and spoke cordially.

"I am glad to see you again, Mrs. Dunlap, but I am afraid that my
daughter will not be able to do so, this evening; she has had a
somewhat trying day and is feeling to-night as though she could not
talk with anybody. She seems nervously unstrung with her recent
experiences. She has retired, I think, but perhaps you will trust me
with a message?"

Mrs. Dunlap reached a quick decision. "Perhaps I had better tell you
all about it," she said, speaking as an intimate friend might have
done. "I have taken a room at the Delport House, and shall not leave
until sometime to-morrow afternoon I think. If Daisy is feeling better,
I could see her in the morning. I hope you will pardon my interest in
your daughter and my familiar use of her name. She and I grew quite
intimate during that one day you know."

The mother's quick thought was, "What would she think if she knew that
I had just been told to say 'Marguerite!'"

Mary Dunlap, noting the troubled glance of the mother hurried on:

"I had a precious little girl of my own, once, about your daughter's
age, Mrs. Sheldon. She was my only child. That night when your daughter
stayed with me in my room was the first time I had ever been able to
say with my whole heart, 'Thank God my Margaret is forever safe in the
Everlasting arms!'

"That is my apology for intruding on you again. And now, perhaps it
would be wiser for me to have my talk with you, leaving you to repeat
as much or as little as you see fit, to your daughter."

Mrs. Sheldon answered quickly, excitedly: "Oh, I wish you would!" she
said, "I have so longed to see you and ask you a lot of questions.
Won't you sit down? And please, tell me first, about that night at the
hotel. I know so very little about it, and I want to understand exactly
what happened. Daisy is very vague in her story, and is so excitable
that I dare not question her in her present state. All that I now know
positively is that because of crowded conditions at the hotel, you
kindly permitted her to share your room for the night."

"Is it possible that you have not been told the whole story!" exclaimed
Mary Dunlap in amazement. It seemed incredible that such a girl as the
one she had protected had kept her mother in ignorance of the whole of
that night's happenings.

"Oh, tell me quickly!" said the mother, with instant premonition,
dropping down on the edge of the couch where the caller had seated
herself. "Tell me all, please. I have been utterly at a loss to
understand Daisy's unstrung state of mind."

Mary Dunlap wondered wildly where she should begin and then plunged
into her subject.

"First, may I ask, please, about this Mr. Keller whom I met that night
with your daughter? Of course I knew nothing of him whatever. Is he a
personal acquaintance of yours? A—friend?"

There was an instant flash of indignation in the mother's eyes.

"Certainly not!" she replied with almost haughtiness in her voice. "I
have met him but once and I have never liked anything that I have heard
about him. He is a sort of a traveling agent I believe for some New
York firm, and business seems to call him to this particular town more
frequently than I could wish. My daughter thinks that I am prejudiced
against him because of certain stories we have heard about him, which
she thinks have no foundation except in malicious gossip. But frankly,
he is a source of much anxiety to me.

"For the past few months he has been quite attentive to Daisy, that
is, as attentive as circumstances would allow, and I—do not trust him.
I do not know why. But I don't! I am utterly at a loss to account for
the influence he seems to have acquired over her in the few brief
meetings they have had. She thinks me hard and cruel because I well, I
can scarcely bear the sound of his name! And yet I have to confess that
I have no good reason to offer for such a feeling. It appears that he
really asked her to marry him. The idea is so obnoxious to me that I
can scarcely bear to utter the words!"

"And this trip they were taking together," ventured the troubled
questioner; "you knew about it of course?"

"Trip!" exclaimed the mother indignantly. "They were not traveling
together! Why, I sent her away on this visit to get her out of his
vicinity because I heard that he was intending to remain in this
town several weeks! They simply met on the train. Daisy thinks it
was a coincidence I suppose from what she says, but of course, he
followed her. I am positive of that. To put it plainly, he seems to
be infatuated with her. And she, poor child, has admitted to me this
very afternoon that she loves him with all her heart! Oh, it seems so
terrible for me to be telling this to you, a stranger, burdening you
with my anxiety."

Mrs. Sheldon wiped the tears away from her eyes, and struggled to keep
more from falling. "But you have been so kind to me and to Daisy, and
there has been no one to whom I could go for advice."

Mary Dunlap slipped an arm around the shoulders of the mother with
strong reassurance.

"My dear!" she said in her warm comforting strong voice, "Just you cry
if you want to, and don't worry about telling me. I'm used to helping
mothers and girls. It is my job in life. And don't you worry. I'm going
to help you, and I thank God I can. I'm glad too that you have told me
this, for now I can speak frankly and tell you all I know. It is going
to make things a lot easier to set right. And now, I've got to tell you
the whole story."



CHAPTER V

THE voice was low and tender in which she began her story of the
afternoon on the train. She made it plain that she had been so busy
with her writing that she scarcely noticed who got on the train until
toward evening when her work was done. She had been barely conscious of
the two who took the seat in front of her, had given them but a swift
glance and decided that they were bride and groom; until her work was
done and she had leisure to look around. And then almost at once she
was fascinated by the lovely face of the girl in front of her.

Mary Dunlap was quick to note the pleased relaxing of the troubled face
as she said this, and the instant sympathy as she gave her own first
impression of the man who was sitting beside the girl.

But as the tale progressed showing how late the train was, with
inevitable missed connections, the mother's eye kindled with gratitude.

"Oh!" she interrupted, "I'm so glad you were there! What would Daisy
have done if you had not been. She is so unused to traveling alone!"

Mary Dunlap went on to tell of the apparent argument between the two
in front of her, the discomfort on the face of the girl, and her own
continued wonder that such a girl should apparently be married to a
man so much older, and of such a type. The mother gave a little gasp
of dismay as she realized that this fine Christian woman had actually
thought her daughter was married to that man! But it was only the
dismay she had felt before at the horrible thought of him, and the old
resentment at the idea of his presuming to be intimate with her girl.

Not until the story progressed to the point where Mrs. Dunlap stood
before the hotel desk writing her own name in the registry and noted
the names on the line just above her own, "R. H. Keller and wife," did
the mother grasp the full meaning of it all. Then she leaned forward
with a quick little motion and caught at both the firm capable hands of
her visitor, crying:

"Oh, Mrs. Dunlap! You don't mean it! You can't mean that he dared do a
thing like that! The wretch! The—the—beast!"

Her eyes were full of tears again. She could not seem to be able to get
words strong enough to express her horror and disgust.

"But of course my Daisy didn't know that!" she said lifting up her head
with a gleam of hope, though there was a sob in the end of her voice.

"Not until I told her, some time afterwards," said Mary Dunlap.

"You told her! She knows! And yet she could tell me to-day that she
loves him! Oh! What shall I do?"

"Wait, dear Mrs. Sheldon," said Mrs. Dunlap putting a detaining hand on
the drooping shoulder. "Love is a strange thing. It throws illusions
over the object that turn it into something entirely different. You
must remember that. Don't blame Daisy too much. She explained to me at
once after her first startled look, that of course he had done that to
protect her reputation, since they had been delayed and all their plans
upset. She said that they had expected to reach San Fergus at midnight,
and that a minister friend of Mr. Keller's was to have met the train
and performed the marriage ceremony. She said that Mr. Keller had
telegraphed ahead for the bridal suite to be reserved for them in the
San Fergus hotel."

"My Daisy told you that!"

It was years before Mrs. Dunlap forgot the tone, and the look on that
mother's face when she said those words. It was as if some one had
suddenly taken from her everything that was worth while in life, as if
she felt that all the years of tender rearing, and care of precious
love and companionship between her and her child were suddenly wiped
out in one great awful act of disloyalty and broken faith with her
mother. Oh, there would be a reaction by and by when the mother would
excuse, and forgive, and bleed over her darling; but this first blow
was like the very severing of the life bond between them, and it was
terrible to witness.

Mary Dunlap felt that it was a pity that the girl had not had to suffer
that look herself with full understanding of all that it meant to her
wonderful little mother.

"My dear! I feel like a surgeon performing an operation, but you must
know it all," said Mary Dunlap tenderly.

"Oh, yes, yes," breathed the mother sorrowfully. "If there is more, go
on. It seems as if nothing mattered if Daisy, my Daisy, would go to
such lengths. Actually running away to get married!"

"My dear friend, you must remember that she thinks she is very much in
love, and that she feels that you have been deceived about her loved
one. They were planning to send you a telegram immediately as soon
as the ceremony was performed, and were counting confidently on your
immediate change of feeling so soon as the inevitable step was taken.
You must remember also that your daughter was greatly troubled even
then, at the momentary deception.

"As the time drew near, and the delay became inevitable, she began
to see the whole thing in more nearly its true light, and it caused
her deep distress. So much so that when Mr. Keller left her for a few
moments in the hotel parlor where we both were waiting for our rooms
to be prepared, she utterly forgot my presence, and began walking up
and down the room, and actually giving a little moan of distress. It
was then that I dared to interfere and offer my sympathy and any help I
could give."

"Oh, how can I ever thank you! How can I thank God enough for having
sent you there!" moaned the stricken mother.

"I think He did plan that I should be there," said Mary Dunlap
reverently. "I was scheduled to be far from there at that time, had
important speaking engagements to fill, and could not understand why
all my plans were frustrated, but it seems that the Father had need
of a servant right there, and perhaps this was more important than
any meeting I could have addressed. I began to feel so as soon as
your Daisy turned to me so readily, so even eagerly, like the little
flower-faced child that she is.

"I had no difficulty in getting her to tell me her trouble. She trusted
me at once, and when I offered my room as a refuge for the night she
accepted most eagerly. Even when I told her how she was booked in the
registry, she did not turn from me, as I feared she might. Instead she
seemed aghast for a moment; then her loyalty to her lover made her at
once attempt to excuse him. However, that did not prevent her from
begging me to take her to the room immediately, before he returned from
his telegraphing. She seemed to actually fear his influence upon her
and to know that her only safe course was to go while he was gone."

"Oh, my poor child!" moaned the mother.

"She made it very plain that Mr. Keller had overpersuaded her to
this marriage, and that while she could not bear to refuse him, she
yet longed to wait until your consent could be obtained. Of course I
advised her strongly that this was the only possible right course, and
she seemed to agree with me."

"Yes, Daisy is very conscientious that is she was, before this came.
But she seems to be infatuated with that man! She has at this moment
more faith in him than in anyone else, I believe."

"Well, she was glad to get to my room then, at least," said the other
woman. "She even wanted the door locked, and when I started to go down
and tell Mr. Keller that she was safe and comfortable for the night
with a woman, she begged me to lock the door and take the key with me!"

"And yet she can say she loves him, when she cannot trust him! And at
such a time! Oh, my little girl!"

"Dear friend, the human heart is a curious thing, and the devil has
many illusions wherewith to deceive, you know."

"And did you actually go down and talk to that man? What a wonderful
heaven-sent friend you proved to be!"

"I did. I'm afraid I rather enjoyed the commission. You must remember I
had been watching him in the train for several hours, and while he was
most courteous and assiduous in caring for her, and did nothing that I
could really put my finger on with which to find fault, I had acquired
the same feeling toward him that you seem to have. I just could not see
how that little flower of a girl could have married him. And of course
when I talked with your daughter, finding out they were not married
after having seen how he registered, my feelings were anything but
lenient toward him."

"I should think so! But oh, my little girl! What would her father have
said if he could have known she was to pass through a thing like this!"

"Courage, dear sister. I am sure God means something lovely to come out
of all this."

"How could that possibly be!" moaned the mother, "Oh, if she could have
been spared any contact with a creature like that! It is so terrible to
see her pass through such an experience. My little Daisy!"

"Yes, but Mrs. Sheldon, think, if she did not have you in this trying
time!"

Suddenly there occurred an interruption. The two women became aware
that the maid had answered a ring at the door, and had let in someone
who was standing in the doorway of the room where they were sitting.

Mrs. Sheldon got up quickly, with a hasty dab at her wet eyelashes and
went toward him.

Mary Dunlap looked up to see a tall young man standing in the doorway
with his hat in his hand, a grave questioning look upon his face. He
had keen gray eyes, a crop of nicely groomed reddish curls, and he
looked strong and young and dependable.

"Oh, Nelson!" exclaimed Mrs. Sheldon, a kind of dazed relief in her
voice, "You came to see Daisy about that committee meeting, didn't you?
Why—she—she wasn't feeling very well to-night, Nelson. She has retired.
She had a headache. She asked me to excuse her."

The grave eyes took on a look of anxiety.

"Daisy not well?" he said as if that were an unheard of thing.

"I should have telephoned you not to come," apologized Mrs. Sheldon,
"but this friend of hers—this friend of mine—arrived just then, from
out of town, and it slipped my mind. Let me introduce you to Mrs.
Dunlap, Nelson. Mrs. Dunlap, Mr. Whitney."

"A friend of Daisy's?" said the young man his grave eyes lighting
pleasantly, and he stepped forward and grasped Mrs. Dunlap's hand,
giving her a swift searching glance.

"I certainly am!" said Mary Dunlap with a hearty handclasp.

He lingered only a minute or two to leave a message for the daughter
about what had happened at the committee meeting, but he gave another
keen parting glance accompanied by a warming smile as he left, that
made the stranger feel that he approved of her, and that he understood
that she was in no wise the cause of the tears that he had seen on
Daisy's mother's face.

After he was gone, Mrs. Sheldon came back to her caller.

"Why couldn't it have been that young man?" asked Mary Dunlap with a
sigh!

"Oh, if it only could have been!" sighed the mother. "He is the dearest
boy! My husband trusted him so. He has been Daisy's schoolmate and
companion for years, and yet she could think she has fallen in love
with that other creature!"

"There, there, dear friend. I tell you the human heart is a mystery.
And a girl at Daisy's age gets queer ideas sometimes. She will come out
of it and be fine and beautiful. You see!"

"Oh! I don't know!" sighed the mother. "She is so strange! Not even
willing to see Nelson. She thought it was Nelson when you came, and
rushed away telling me she would not see him nor anyone else to-night!
I could not tell him that of course. He has been so kind and so
devoted. And I can see that he is terribly worried about this Keller.
He looks as if he would like to fight every time Daisy mentions his
name. But tell me, what did the fellow do when you told him Daisy was
going to remain with you for the night?"

"Do? He was fairly insolent. He was furious. He told me to mind my
own business. He strode around that parlor like a madman, till I told
him Daisy had appealed to me for protection, and had told me she was
not yet married to him; but that I had seen how he registered in the
hotel. Then he calmed down a little and began to try to smooth things
over. He tried to explain that he had done that merely to protect the
girl, and that he intended to make everything right for her. He even
came to the point, before we were done, of saying that perhaps he had
been wrong in doing it, but he had followed an impulse when he wrote.
Oh, you know how a man like that could lie himself out of anything! He
even said that of course if Daisy preferred to be with me, it was all
right, but he really must see her before she slept and arrange about
his telegrams. Of course I saw through that. He knew his influence over
her!

"So I told him she had asked not to be disturbed, and that she did not
wish to see him again until she was at home with her mother and her
mother knew all. Then he began to rave at me of course but I let him
understand that I should not hesitate to call for assistance if he
made further trouble, and I fancy he did not care for publicity, so he
withdrew with what grace he could."

"And then?"

"Well, strange to say we had no further trouble with him. I had looked
up trains and found there was a very early one. Perhaps he was asleep,
although I was taking no chances. I decided to stay by till I placed
her safely in her mother's care."

"You have been wonderful!" said the mother. "I can never thank you.
And I'm glad too, that you came and told me all to-night. It has been
very hard to hear, but it was right that I should know. Only, my dear
new strong friend, I don't know what I am going to do. I am terrified
at what may yet develop. I am sure that man will not be easily shaken
off. He is probably only waiting till Daisy gets all strained up with
anxiety, as she is now, when he knows she will be wax in his hands. I
cannot believe he will give up so easily. He will know that you cannot
linger around to protect always, and unfortunately, he is not afraid of
me."

"My dear, wait until you have heard the rest of the story."

"Oh, is there more?" The mother's face showed a new terror.

She sat up tense and anxious clasping her frail hands in one another
till the knuckles showed white.

"No, dear Mrs. Sheldon, don't be frightened," went on Mary Dunlap. "I
will try to be as brief as possible, but I am sure you should know
everything."

"Oh, yes!" implored the white lipped mother.

Mary Dunlap's heart ached for her as she went on with the story:

"After I left Daisy with you that morning I went directly to New York
where I was to be entertained by a Mrs. Oliver whom I had met a number
of times in connection with my public work. She had often invited me to
be her guest and talk over various matters with her, but I had never
been able to arrange a definite date before. I arrived at midnight, and
was taken almost at once to my room, seeing none of the family that
night except my hostess.

"But the next morning at breakfast I was introduced to her two lovely
daughters, and a moment later to her husband who had arrived a few
moments before on an early train from the West. Perhaps you can imagine
my horror when I looked up to greet him, and found that the man to whom
Mrs. Oliver was introducing me, calling him 'her husband Mr. Oliver,'
was the Mr. Keller from whom your daughter had been rescued a few
nights before!"

Mary Dunlap had told the end of her story rapidly, conscious that her
listener was under a heavy strain, and now she looked up with relief
that all was told.

But the poor mother had borne all she could. She suddenly drooped and
would have fallen if the caller had not put strong arms about her and
laid her gently on the couch.

"My dear!" she said as she stooped over the poor sufferer and patted
her gently. "My dear! Don't feel so terribly about it. I am sure this
part of the story should be a relief, for it certainly puts that man in
a position where he dare not touch your daughter again!"

"But oh, to have my Daisy, my baby, mixed up with a man like that!"
wailed the utterly crushed little mother, "It seems as though I never
can lift my head again!"

"Oh, my dear! That is a very small part of the whole matter. The main
thing is that no harm shall come to the child. No one here knows, of
course, and he has promised!"

But a new voice broke in the room, clear and ringing and cold like a
young Nemesis. "What are you doing to my mother? Have you come here to
make more trouble for us? Who are you, anyway?"



CHAPTER VI

THE girl stood in the doorway, her eyes flashing like blue flames, her
delicate profile outlined against the rich portier, chin lifted, in
scorn, the light catching the glint of the waves in her pretty hair and
turning them into gold, the delicate blue of her silk kimono bringing
out the pearly tint of her skin, a haughty little patrician, insolent
in her loveliness.

Mary Dunlap looked at her in pity, and admiration, and a rising wonder.
Was this the girl who had melted to tears in her arms but a few nights
before, and implored her to protect her? How lovely she was even in
her frenzy. She made a picture as she stood there in her rightful
background. Poor, misguided infant! What a hard road she had set her
feet to travel, and how soon she must come to humiliation.

But the mother was shocked into severity. "Marguerite!" she said,
sitting bolt upright and looking at her daughter sternly, as she had
not looked at nor spoken to her since she was a very little girl,
"Marguerite! You forget yourself! You are beside yourself. Apologize
at once to Mrs. Dunlap. You do not know what you are doing! Mrs.
Dunlap is the best friend you have in this world. She has gone to
great inconvenience and expense and trouble to save you from an awful
calamity!"

The Marguerite of a few days ago would have been crushed to earth by
such words from her beloved mother. Not so the girl of that night. She
did not even wince. Instead she drew herself up to her full height
and looked her mother steadily in the eyes, as if their ages had been
reversed, and spoke with a certain air of authority that was almost
startling.

"No, I am not beside myself, Mother! It is you who do not know what
you are doing. You have allowed yourself to be blinded by an utter
stranger. You have swallowed whole the lies she has handed out to
you. Mother, I understand it all now. This woman is a rank imposter,
employed by others to ruin the reputation of a prominent and successful
business man, in order to extort money from him. Oh, I have heard a
lot that she has been saying! Don't try to stop me. Isn't this kind of
thing being done every day now? The daily papers are full of it. Why,
even novels are just full of plots like that.

"Didn't that horrid woman whose latest book is being lauded in every
column of reviews make one of her characters boast of being a daughter
of Eve to some purpose because she had told some successful lies about
one of her victims? I tell you, Mother, you don't know the world. Times
have changed since you were a girl. You think every woman is good,
simply because she is a woman and dresses respectably. That is why you
are willing to believe all these terrible things about Rufus, and why
you want me to believe them. Just because a woman has told you. Just
ask her how much she is to be paid to bring about his ruin. Ask her
that! Do you suppose she is to be paid whether she succeeds or not?
It must be she isn't; that is why she is so persistent, sneaking in
to tell tales to you when I'm not by, and get you on her side. She
evidently is afraid she is going to lose her money!"

"Marguerite! Oh, my poor child!" exclaimed the mother in horror,
beginning to cry. "Oh, Mrs. Dunlap, I beg you will forgive her. She
doesn't know what she is saying."

"That is perfectly all right, Mrs. Sheldon, don't think of it for a
moment. I understand."

But the girl's voice broke in scornfully:

"I certainly do know what I am saying. I understand it all perfectly. I
can see the plot clearly now. I remember how this woman sat behind us
in the cars, doubtless of purpose, listening to us. She was writing all
the afternoon. I suppose she took down our private conversation. She
probably carries on such business constantly, and chooses her victims
among those who look as if they would care about their reputations and
have plenty of money to hush up such tales. That is called blackmail,
Mother, and I've read quite a lot about it in the papers. But they
are not going to frighten us. Rufus and I will search this thing out
to the foundations and make it impossible for this woman ever to get
in her deadly work on any other good Christian man. It would be even
worth sacrificing ourselves if we could do that. It is because people
are afraid that they succumb to such things as this. We are not afraid!
This woman listened to our plans and discussions, and knew just where
to get us, that is all. If I hadn't been such a fool, I would have
understood at the time, and I shouldn't have yielded to the spell she
cast over me. She must be a hypnotist. She somehow succeeded in making
everything look different from what it really is. But she can't do it
again. I've got my eyes open!"

These are a few of the indignant sarcasms that the two long-suffering
women had to listen to as the evening passed on. Mrs. Sheldon,
mortified to the extreme of agony over the way her daughter was raving
out against the wonderful woman who had saved her from a life of
humiliation; alarmed beyond measure for the sanity of the one who was
dearer to her than life, roused from her own weakness and tried every
possible means to bring the girl to reason, all to no purpose.

At last Mary Dunlap who had stood by helpless, trying to think of
something she might say which would bring the girl to her senses,
leaned over toward the mother and said in a low tone:

"Suppose I just go away for the night now. She is excited and the sight
of me only irritates her. If she could get some sleep she might be more
reasonable in the morning. No, don't get up. I can find my own way to
the door. You can telephone if you need me. I shall stay close to my
room till I hear from you. And I will pray! Don't despair, dear sister!
God is strong! Now—I will just slip away!"

The keen ears of the excited girl caught the last sentence.

"Yes, slip away by all means! I should have thought it might have
occurred to you to do so before!" she flung after the stranger.

And then, as the door closed after Mary Dunlap, Marguerite Sheldon
began to pace the floor, the very personification of indignant fury.

After she had exhausted herself with wild words, she suddenly flung
herself down before her mother with her head in her mother's lap and
began to sob:

"Oh, Mother, Mother, that dreadful woman has made me almost crazy!" she
sobbed. "Some of the time I don't seem to know what I am saying. But
I know this, and I mean it. I know that Rufus is true to me, and not
only to me, but to God. He is very religious, Mother, he really is! You
ought to hear him talk. And Mother, I know I love him, love him, with
my whole soul! And I shall, forever and ever! No matter how many fiends
from the underworld combine to try and make me false to him!"

At the word "love" her sobbing suddenly ceased and she sprang to her
feet and began pacing up and down the room again; her voice rising to
almost a shriek.

Of what use to attempt any further words with one who was surely not
responsible for what she said or did? The mother slipped to her knees
and began to pray.

A voice of power spoke to her soul, while she was still on her knees,
seeking help. It almost seemed to her that she had heard the spoken
words:

"'I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; I will lead them
in paths that they have not known. I will make darkness light before
them; and crooked things straight.'"

Oh, the wonderful words! Could there be a human being any blinder than
her Daisy? And, how terribly she needed new "paths!"

It was because of this amazing voice that she was able to get through
that night, and the early part of the next day and finally to persuade
her daughter to receive Mrs. Dunlap in the evening, and hear from her
lips what she had to tell.

This was in accordance with that lady's earnest request made over the
telephone, she having decided that the mother was physically unable
to endure further strain. But that Christian worker had certainly
occasion to look back upon the hour spent with Daisy Sheldon as one of
the hardest in her by no means easy life. Not that Daisy did not try,
at least at first, to treat her in accordance with all the rules of
propriety.

But as the story progressed, there was all the time in the narrator's
mind the question, "How shall I convince this girl that I am speaking
only truth!" She who was used to being trusted implicitly, and quoted
as unquestioned authority on all points connected with the work to
which she had given her life!

Yet this girl listened in outward calm to the story that had caused her
mother's lapse into almost unconsciousness, with a half smile on her
lips, that deepened into a sneer when she finally spoke:

"That is a very strange story, Mrs. Dunlap! Being as well acquainted
with Mr. Keller as I am, I don't quite understand how I could be
expected to credit it! I should really like to see a photograph of
this mysterious person, to help me in conceiving how a woman of your
discernment could have been so deceived! Although I should remember
that your acquaintance with Mr. Keller covered a very brief space of
time; while he is, of course, my closest friend."

Could this be the girl who had so very recently clung to her, weeping,
and begging to be shielded from even the sight of the man who was her
"closest friend!" How could Mrs. Dunlap help giving a second's thought
to such a question? But she turned swiftly from it and tried again.

"Wait, please," she said patiently, "I must tell you the rest. I have
had a longer acquaintance with the man than you have heard as yet.
After breakfast Mrs. Oliver asked him to take me into the library and
show me some prints while she attended to other duties, and when he had
closed and locked the doors, he threw himself on my mercy and begged me
not to wreck his household by telling his wife and children what I knew
about him. He did not attempt to deny that he was of course the same
Mr. Keller with whom I had held a long conversation two nights before.

"In fact, he frankly owned that you had been what he called a
'temptation' to him, but that the marriage ceremony which he professed
at that time to be about to enter into, had been only a joke, of
course, intended to relieve your anxieties for being away from your
mother longer than you had planned. I would not like to tear your heart
nor soil my lips by repeating the words that he used to describe your
wonderful mother and her ignorant prejudice as he called it.

"He also told me that his friend who posed as a minister for the time
being was an amateur play actor who had successfully impersonated a
clergyman while they were in college, which gave him the idea of a mock
marriage to quiet your protests.

"And now, I will show you a paper written and signed by this man, in
which he pledges never to write or telegraph or telephone you, or
visit you again. It is a paper that I went back to secure, after I had
started on this western trip, and the man knows that his keeping this
agreement both in letter and spirit is the price of my silence toward
his wife and children. His wife is a charming and beautiful woman, and
his two daughters are as sweet and charming as yourself. It seemed
terrible to wreck that home, but I would not keep silence unless I felt
sure you would be safe forever from him."

Marguerite Sheldon tilted her patrician chin haughtily, a little smile
of scorn on her lovely lips.

"Mrs. Dunlap," she said, "you certainly are mistress of your
profession. You have worked out your evil plot to the last detail, I
see. You must have gone to great pains to counterfeit Mr. Keller's hand
writing. Perhaps stolen some of his own letters from my handbag to
copy while I slept. It is certainly cleverly done. And of course this
remarkable interview is a part of the whole scheme. One wonders whether
you were cunning enough to concoct it on the spur of the moment, or
whether you had it all prepared in reserve, if you found I did not fall
for your story at once? Of course I know the daily papers are full of
such tales of blackmail and the like. Perhaps if my tastes lay in that
direction and I had posted myself better on the ways of such people
as you, I might have been saved even the first humiliation of giving
way before you and yielding to your influence which I now thoroughly
believe to have been hypnotic.

"Of course I might have saved your time by saying all this before I
heard you, but my mother was so anxious that I should let you speak
that I have listened to your remarkable tale with what patience I could
summon. But now I think we have had enough of this farce. I wish to
distinctly state just now that I believe in Mr. Keller's honor and
integrity as entirely as I did before this insane plot was planned; and
until I hear from his own lips that he did not intend to marry me that
night, and that he is not Mr. Rufus Keller, and never was, I shall not
believe one word of this story; and I shall remain as I am now, his
promised wife until he comes to claim me."

Before this outburst the baffled woman sat silent, dumbfounded. Such
beautiful faith in such a worthless man had never come her way. She was
not troubled over the insults that had been flung at her. The situation
had become too grave to be thinking of self. The question that fairly
appalled her was, how was it possible to save this poor blind child
from her own folly? Suddenly she resolved to try one more thing. It
seemed the last resort.

"Miss Sheldon," she said, speaking earnestly and looking straight into
the flashing eyes of the angry girl, "will you put this thing to the
test? Will you accompany me on the midnight Express to New York where I
will take you to call on Mr. Ralph Oliver in his private office, Number
— Fifth Avenue, that he may tell you himself that he is the Mr. Keller
whom you know so well? I happen to know that he is to be in his office
to-morrow morning. Will you go?"

What would the girl reply to this challenge?

What she did was to rise in utter silence and move swiftly across
the room to the door, which she opened, and closed after her with a
distinct slam!



CHAPTER VII

MARY DUNLAP, left alone in the big beautiful room with the echo of the
scornful young words, and the echo of that slammed door hurting into
her soul, suddenly rested her elbow on the arm of the chair in which
she sat, and dropped her tired head upon her hand. With closed eyes
she prayed, her soul crying out from the depth of her failure. She had
done her best for this little sister and she had utterly failed. Now
she called upon her Father for sustaining strength, for light, for
guidance, for calmness in the midst of despair; for the headstrong
blinded girl, and for the worn despairing mother.

Then out of her despair came peace, and suddenly a knowledge that the
Father cared more than she did, even more than the stricken mother.

She became aware of the entrance of that mother, quietly, like a little
sad wraith.

Lifting her head she tried to smile but failed.

"It was no use!" she said sadly, "She would not believe a word that I
said."

"Oh, my dear strong friend!" breathed the little mother, "What should
I do without you? I have been praying while you were down here. I
cannot think my little girl is to be allowed to go to destruction, or
lose her mind, or anything. She is a child of the covenant. Her father
and I dedicated her to the Lord when she was born. He cannot desert
us! You don't think He would let her go like this, do you? She is—a
church-member—of course—and has always seemed—a Christian. Haven't I a
right to claim His promises for my child?"

"You certainly have," said the strong hearty voice. "Come let us kneel
down now and claim that promise, 'Where two of you shall agree as
touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my
Father.'"

So the two women knelt hand in hand beside the couch and poured out
their hearts in prayer for the foolish girl, till it seemed that their
yearning words must be already spread before the mercy seat, and
perhaps the swift answer on its way; and new strength and courage came
into the mother's heart.

Upstairs there were hurrying footsteps for a few minutes, and then
silence, but if the two petitioners heard them it was only to be
thankful that they were not the regular measured frantic tread that had
been going back and forth all day. Perhaps she was resting at last.

They rose with a peace upon their faces.

"Now," said Mary Dunlap, "it is time you went to bed and to sleep.
We have put the whole matter in the Father's hands and we cannot do
anything else till He shows us. Suppose you run upstairs and see if
she is all right, and then, if she is resting, I will go back to the
hotel and let you get to bed, for I'm sure I won't be needed any more
to-night."

"You have been so wonderful!" murmured Mrs. Sheldon. "What should I
have done without you? Why not stay here to-night? Our guest room is
always ready, and then we can talk things over in the morning."

"No," said Mary Dunlap decidedly. "It is better for me to be out of the
house. The child resents my presence just now, and will come to herself
twice as quickly if she is alone with her mother. Get a good night's
rest, and perhaps she will see things differently in the morning. Sleep
does a great deal toward bringing sane vision."

"Oh, I do hope she is asleep! She never even lay down last night, just
walked the floor and talked in that wild frantic way and then cried! I
never saw anybody cry like that, so despairingly, so resentfully! It
frightened me! But really, I cannot let you go back to the hotel at
this time of night. It must be very late indeed. I'm sure I heard the
midnight train go down quite a few minutes ago. It isn't safe for a
woman to be out alone so late."

"Nonsense!" laughed Mary Dunlap. "My dear, nobody would touch me. I've
been out at all hours in all kinds of places, and shall often be if I
live. It doesn't bother me a bit. Come, run up and see if the child
is all right and then I'll go. You mustn't lose any more sleep. Can't
I just stand here at the foot of the stairs and you wave to me if all
is well? Is the night latch on the door? And does that light turn out
from above? Then I'll shut the door after me, and you needn't come down
again to-night. Good night, dear, brave, little mother. I'll call you
up in the morning and see how the Father is answering our prayer."

Mrs. Sheldon pressed the other woman's hand, and then tiptoed upstairs
softly. Her footfalls were muffled in the heavy texture of costly
rugs, and Mary Dunlap waited below, looking up for her signal, yawning
wearily and suddenly realizing that she felt very old and tired.

But the footsteps did not return at once as she had expected. It seemed
a long time before she suddenly heard Mrs. Sheldon almost running
across the floor above, rushing through the hall and down the stairs a
fluttering paper in her hand. Her face was chalk white in the subdued
light of the hall chandelier and her eyes burned dark with fright.

"She is gone!" she cried, her voice catching in a sob. "She is not
there at all. She has gone to New York!"

She thrust a paper into Mrs. Dunlap's hand and dropped down upon the
lowest step of the stair in a little crushed heap, her face in her
hands.

Mrs. Dunlap was reading the letter that had been given her:

   Dear Mother: (it read)

   There is only one thing left for me to do, and that is to go to number
— Fifth Avenue New York and Prove that there is no Mr. Ralph Oliver.
After I have done that, I shall go and find Rufus and we will be
married at once! It is my duty to save Rufus from this terrible plot
against his character. After that, we will take care of you. Don't
worry. I will let you hear from me.

                       Lovingly,

                             DAISY.

Mary Dunlap read the letter over twice, while Mrs. Sheldon cried
softly. Then the elder woman spoke:

"I know what you are thinking. You think the Lord has not heard your
prayer. But you must not think that. I heard a great preacher from
England once say that we must learn to 'trust Him where we could not
trace Him,' and I think that if God has been preparing this thing while
we were praying and claiming His promise, that in some way it is to
answer our prayer. Come, let us trust Him, and tell him so."

Right there by the stairs Mary Dunlap prayed, talking to the Lord as
if He stood where she could see Him, asking directions for what they
should do next.

When the brief prayer was over the mother lifted her head and stood up.

"Daisy is not used to traveling alone! Especially out in the night this
way, and to a great city!" She spoke in a tone of deep anguish.

"She is not alone!" said Mary Dunlap solemnly, "God is with her!"

Then after an instant she added:

"And there is no reason why we should not follow, is there? Wouldn't
that be what the Lord would want? When is the next train?"

"Not until five o'clock in the morning," sighed the mother.

"Even so," said the steady traveler, "we shall not be so far behind
her, and perhaps this was the only way to convince her, to let her see
that it is all true. Sister, we've got to trust our Father! There just
isn't anything else to do!"

Daisy's mother looked up with a weak little trembling smile and with
lips that quivered as she spoke the words, said:

"All right!"

"You good little sport!" said Mary Dunlap, and stooped down and kissed
her.

"Now," she said, "sit down a minute while we plan. I'll go back to the
hotel and pack my grip. It takes just five minutes, I've done it in a
hurry so many times. Then I'll get all the information needed about the
train, and order a taxi to come for us, and I'll come back here. That
ought not to take me more than three quarters of an hour. Let me see.
It's now quarter of one. I'll be back here at half past. In the mean
time, are you strong enough to get together what few things you'll need
on the way while I'm gone? And can't you call your maid and give her
directions about leaving the house for a few days? You can telegraph
her afterward of course if you forget anything. Is she trustworthy?"

"She's been with us fifteen years," said Mrs. Sheldon. "She simply
takes care of us."

"That's good then. Let's go. Work fast, and be done when I get back so
we can get a few winks of sleep. Oh, yes, you've got to sleep or you
would be sick and that wouldn't do. But you don't need to bother about
breakfast. We'll get that on the train. Now, I'm off!"

Mary Dunlap was as good as her word, did all she had promised to do
with a few minor details thrown in. She was efficiency itself when it
came to any kind of a crisis. She was back three minutes ahead of her
schedule and standing over the poor bewildered mother, whose eyes kept
blurring with tears as she tried to go about and gather up the things
she would need.

"Now," said Mary Dunlap looking down at the open suitcase, only half
packed, "what have you got in here? Night dress and toilet things? A
couple of other dresses, one for daytime and one for evening. Yes,
you can't tell what we may run into on this jaunt! Always look out
for any emergency, and two extra dresses will generally do it. Now, a
warm kimono, slippers and another pair of shoes, a change of underwear
that's about all. You'll want to take your pen perhaps and a few extra
handkerchiefs. I've done this so much it is second nature. Sometimes I
almost have to live on the cars."

"It seems as if I just couldn't think."

"Well, don't try, I'll do it for you. How about Daisy, did she take
anything with her? She certainly didn't have much time. It must have
been after eleven o'clock when she went upstairs and she wrote that
note before she left."

"Yes, her suit case is gone. I don't really know how much is missing.
Perhaps she hadn't fully unpacked it since she came home."

"Did she have money?"

"I don't know how much. She has her own bank account, and probably
has her check book. They know her at the station of course and would
cash her check. That makes me think, I wonder how much money I have in
the house? Perhaps Daisy has taken it. She is always free to go to my
drawer when she runs out of money."

"Don't worry about money. I always carry a few traveler's checks and
I had the hotel order tickets and chairs for us. They will come with
the taxi in the morning. Now, where do you keep your hat and coat and
gloves? Is your hand bag ready? I want you to lie down this minute and
get some sleep. No, don't lie and think about Daisy. Just rest back on
the Father's promise and relax. Everything is going to be all right!"

So Mrs. Sheldon, ready for her journey all but her dress, wrapped her
kimono about her and was tucked up by Mary Dunlap. Surprisingly she
went to sleep, worn out with her two nights of vigil.

Mary Dunlap slept too, little cat naps with a keen squint at her
wristwatch with the aid of her ever ready flashlight stowed under her
pillow.

It was she who slipped down to the strange kitchen at daybreak and made
some good strong coffee. It was she who carried it up and made Mrs.
Sheldon drink it. It was she who inspected the suit case at the last
minute, snapped it shut and carried it down to the door, while Mrs.
Sheldon was giving a few last directions to the sleepy maid who had
loyally stumbled down to say goodbye just as the taxi drew up at the
door.

They had been seated in the train for perhaps an hour when Mrs. Sheldon
said with a troubled look:

"I almost wish I had asked Nelson to come with us. He is so dependable
where Daisy is concerned, and it doesn't seem quite fair to him to run
away without a word. He is so—so—loyal and patient."

"H'm!" mused Mary Dunlap. "Was there—any way you could have asked him?
Would Daisy have resented your telling him?"

"I suppose she would. No, I don't suppose there was," said the
perplexed mother reversing the order of the questions, "but somehow it
seems all wrong not to have him along when we are in trouble."

"Well," said Mary Dunlap thoughtfully, "if the Lord needs him, He'll
know how to send him. Don't you fret."

Fortunately both women were dead with sleep, and were able to get
some real refreshing rest in their chairs while the miles raced along
beneath the wheels, and Daisy drew nearer to New York.

What would Daisy do when she got to New York? Her mother could not keep
the question out of her mind, and yet she could not answer it. Oh, what
awful experience might she not have if she went to that office and met
her old lover! A creature as hardened as he would perhaps think nothing
of spiriting her away somewhere, so that her mother might never see her
again. If she came early alone to his office and found him by himself,
he might tell her any lie, and in her present state of mind, she would
believe it.

On the other hand, what if that Mrs. Oliver or her daughters should
happen to be there when Daisy arrived, and she should say something to
her lover which showed what her relation had been to him, would she and
Daisy ever be able to live after such humiliation?

The poor mother could not fathom the answer to her painful thoughts and
could only pray over and over again in her heart,—

   "Oh Father, keep her, keep my child from falling."

And then like soothing balm there came to her familiar words,—

   "Able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before
the throne—without spot or wrinkle or any such thing."

Oh, how blessedly the old verses learned in childhood came trooping to
her groping thoughts, as if the Father were speaking them to her heart,
while the train carried her on her way.


The long day was accomplished at last, a day during which both the
women slept a good deal and talked a little, finding out common points
of contact, common interests between one another, speaking of Daisy now
and then; of Nelson Whitney occasionally; of Daisy's wonderful father;
and Mrs. Sheldon's girlhood. As the night drew on and the lights began
to appear, the two women began to feel as if they had known each other
for years, and were bound by ties closer even than sisters might have
been. Then there was the long night, to be waked through, thinking of
the possibilities of the morrow.

"Now," said Mary Dunlap looking at her wristwatch the next morning
after they had had breakfast, and come back to their section, in the
sleeper, "it's quarter of nine. We shall be in, in three quarters of an
hour, and take a taxi straight to Fifth Avenue if there isn't time to
go to a hotel. Nothing opens in New York much before ten o'clock. Daisy
got in last night, but all offices were closed. She couldn't have done
anything till this morning, and she can't get there much ahead of us.
At least if she does, she won't see him, for I'm sure he never comes
down to the office before ten, and sometimes later. Take heart, sister,
and trust the Father. He is managing this business, and I fancy He
could have taken care of Daisy even if we hadn't come along. You know
He manages a lot of things without us!"

Mrs. Sheldon blinked back the tears and smiled.

"I know," she said. "I'll try to rest on Him."

And then they began to draw near to the great city, and the two women
put on hats and coats, and sat up ready for action. Who knew what the
day had in store for them?



CHAPTER VIII

NELSON WHITNEY rang the bell of the Sheldon House at exactly quarter
past eight the next morning. It was as early as he felt it would be
at all courteous to disturb the household, especially as one of the
members had not been feeling well the night before.

Mary, the trusted servant of the years, opened the door to him.

"Good morning, Mary," he said familiarly, for he had been almost as
much at home in the Sheldon house since childhood as in his own home.
"Is Marguerite up yet? I don't like to disturb her, but she was to have
some measurements written out for the things she wanted me to get for
the Hospital Fair, and I rather think she is expecting me to see to it
this morning."

"Miss Marguerite is away, Mr. Nelson," said Mary with disapproval in
her voice.

Mary had been with the family too long not to know every time one of
the beloved family winked an eye or shed a tear, and Mary felt that
things were all wrong just now; the idol of her heart crying and
carrying on all day and then running away on the midnight train, and
her mother going at daybreak! It certainly was not right.

"Away?" said Nelson. "Why, she was here yesterday, wasn't she? Her
mother told me she was lying down with a headache last evening when I
telephoned."

"Sure she was here last evening," said Mary, glad to get someone to
share her troubles. "I don't know whatever her mother was thinking
about to let her go, and her having headaches and crying and all
yesterday. But young folks, seems to do about as they please nowadays."

Whitney cast her a pleasant grin, but his eyes showed that he was
troubled.

"Well, I guess then I'll have to see Mrs. Sheldon. If she isn't about
just ask her, please, if Marguerite left any word with her. Or, if
she's asleep yet or anything, just look on Marguerite's desk and see if
you find a paper with my name on it. She's likely written it out and
left it there."

"M's Sheldon's gone too," burst forth Mary. "She left on the five
o'clock with some woman was here all evening and come back and stayed
all night, what there was left of it when they got packed."

Whitney looked up startled.

"Mrs. Sheldon has gone too? And she didn't go with Marguerite? That is
strange. There wasn't a death in the family or anything near relatives
in New York perhaps? I believe they have relatives there, haven't they?
Perhaps they telegraphed for Marguerite."

"No, it couldn't a been that, all the Sheldons and Hamptons in New York
went to Europe a month ago—went for a year."

"Well, it's none of my business of course," said Whitney with a grave
smile that ended with a sigh, "but what in sixty am I going to do about
that committee? They'll be in my hair if I don't get those things for
to-night, and they told me Marguerite had the list. She probably forgot
to say anything to you about it, Mary, going in such a hurry. Suppose
you go up and look around her room and see if you see anything that
looks like a list, whether it has my name on it or not."

"Come on in, then," said Mary graciously, and opened the door wider.

Whitney stepped in and stood in the hall, his glance searching toward
the open doorway where he had stood two nights before, talking to
Mrs. Sheldon. Who was that other woman? Was she connected with this
sudden exodus? He had liked her. She seemed a strong true friend. He
remembered the twinkle in her eyes, though they had looked grave, even
sorrowful as if she was full of sympathy.

He sighed again as he remembered how strange it was to have the family
go off this way without telling him. Heretofore he had always been told
of every change from day to day. His life had been so closely twined
with theirs that they never even changed a piece of furniture from one
room to another without asking him gaily how he liked it in its new
place, always joyously consulting him about any action. When they were
going away, it was always he who got their reservations, checked their
baggage, and took them to the station in his car, that is, since he had
been old enough to have a car. Before that he attended them in a hired
taxi.

But now, the last few months, there had been growing a change. Mrs.
Sheldon was just the same, but Marguerite had a certain reserve, as if
he didn't matter any more. It was all since that night when the Farr
girl brought that Keller fellow with her to their literary club, and
introduced him to Marguerite. Whitney had heard him calling her "Daisy"
the very first night; "Daisy," the name that belonged exclusively to
her mother—and himself—up to that night!

After that, he studiously called her Marguerite. He wanted no name for
his girl that he had to share with that man! He was a villain, that's
what he was, a middle-aged man coming in and presuming to monopolize a
girl almost young enough to be his daughter! What was he anyway, and
what did they know about him? He meant to make it his business pretty
soon to find out, if he persisted in coming around as he had been doing.

Then Mary's voice sailed down the stairway.

"Was it a list of flower seeds and bulbs, you meant, Mr. Nelson?"

Whitney walked over to the foot of the stairs and looked up.

"No, Mary, it would be lumber, and canvas, and curtain material for the
stage setting for the Cantata."

"Oh," said Mary, "this ain't it, then, I'll look again."

Mary went back into the girl's room, and the young man stood there
waiting. He moved his position impatiently and drew another sigh, and
something crackled under his foot. A paper! Probably that was the list.
Marguerite had left it on the hall table and it had blown across the
floor when the door was opened.

He stooped and picked it up. Yes, it was Marguerite's writing. Probably
some directions about color and fabrics. Maybe a bit of a word of
apology for going so hurriedly, or even a friendly goodbye. His heart
was lifted at the thought. His eyes plunged into the midst of the words
in the dim light of the hall, and grasped, searching for that personal
word which he so longed to read. So before he was aware that he was
reading a note addressed to someone else, he had gathered the whole
unhappy truth.

For an instant he stood with the paper quivering in his hand, a sense
of mortification upon him for having read something he shouldn't, yet a
great sinking within his soul for the facts that had been revealed in
that brief note.

So then Daisy Marguerite had gone away without her mother's knowledge!
Marguerite to have done a thing like that! She would never have done
that a year ago! Something terrible must have happened to get her
wrought up to the degree that she would worry her much-loved mother by
doing that.

And of course that explained the mother's hasty leave by the next
train. Mrs. Sheldon would never allow that quietly without doing
something about it. But why, oh, why hadn't she telephoned to him? That
is what she would have done even a few weeks ago! Oh, and what was that
other awful thing the note had said? When she had accomplished her
strange mission, whatever it was, trying to prove that somebody did not
exist, she was going to hunt up that unspeakable villain Keller and
marry him! Could any calamity loom greater than that to Nelson Whitney
in the whole bright world that had suddenly gone black?

At that instant, while he was turning over those awful facts and trying
to make something out of them, he heard Mary's brisk footsteps coming
down the stairs. Instantly he crushed the paper he held and drove his
hand deep into his overcoat pocket.

"I can't find it nowheres, Mr. Nelson," she said, "would you like to go
up and look? You might recognize it when I wouldn't."

Nelson sprang up the steps hastily.

"I'll just take a look about," he said.

But it was not for the list he wanted to go up. He had a feeling that
he must look about the apartment where she had last been as if its very
walls must cry out and give him a clue to go by, some hope for his
anguished soul that was all wrapped up in the little girl he had loved
since childhood, the little girl about to step off into danger! What
could he do about it?

But the room was in perfect order, as Marguerite's room always was,
nothing about to tell any tales, save her little blue sweater, lying
on the bed in a heap as if it had suddenly been cast aside. He stood
for an instant in the doorway, looking around, walked to her desk and
her bureau with a keen swift glance, went back toward the door. Pausing
suddenly beside the bed, he picked up the soft little wool garment and
laid it to his cheek, just an instant, like a caress, and dropping it,
went out of the room and ran swiftly down the stairs.

"D'ya find it?" asked Mary noting triumphantly that he had no list in
his hand.

"No, Mary, it wasn't there," he said. "Thank you. She must have
forgotten it. I'll have to get along the best way I can without it."

"Well, if it turns up when I go to sweep, I'll phone you to the office,
Mr. Nelson."

"Thank you, Mary, and by the way, they didn't say when they were
returning, did they? Or give you an address? I might get her on Long
Distance you know."

"No, they didn't say. M's Sheldon she did say that ef they decided to
stay mor'na day ur so, she'd write and tell me what hotel they put up
at. Ef she does, I'll phone ya, Mr. Nelson."

"All right, Mary. Thank you!" said Nelson Whitney, and closing the door
behind him, went out into the street.

As he got into his car and threw in the clutch, it suddenly came to him
what he must do. His people were off alone, in possible trouble, and he
must be at hand ready if they needed him! He must go to New York and
find them.

But how could he find them since each detachment of them had the start
of him, and might be lost in New York long before he could get there?

He began to calculate distance and time. Marguerite a whole night ahead
of him, and her mother several hours' start! When he reached New York,
they might have already left it. Marguerite might already be married.
And even if he were there, unless he got there ahead and met their
trains, how would he know where they had gone?

Stay! Hadn't that note told a place where Marguerite was going? He
pulled out the crumpled paper and smoothed it, getting the number fixed
in his mind. — Fifth Avenue! Well, at least, he knew one place where
she intended to go, if there was such a place. Her note seemed to imply
that she doubted it. But there would at least be the number whether the
person whose existence she was seeking to disprove, was there or not.

Yes, with only that little clue, and no chance at all of getting
there on time, he meant to go after her! For what could her mother
do? True she might have more information of her whereabouts than was
contained in that note, but even so, she was a woman of another day
and generation, a woman used to being cared for, and not accustomed to
traveling by herself. That other woman had looked capable, of course,
as if she might go around the world by herself, and have no trouble
whatever, but who knew whether that other woman—Dunlap her name was,
wasn't it—who knew, whether she was going all the way to New York or
not?

Yes, he must go! And there was only one way to get there in time to be
of use. Could he do it?

He drove hard down to his office, a very new office with a new
secretary and office boy, new desks and chairs and typewriter, and
new clientele. This was a busy day, too, but that couldn't be helped
either. His boss in Chicago was not a hard master, and anyway his
secretary was efficient if she was rather old and homely.

He plunged into his morning mail. That must be got out of the way
first. Matilda Herrick, the shell-rimmed secretary, had it all in neat
order for him; the new orders, the old customers, the complaints, the
letter from the head office in Chicago. He went through the piles
rapidly, giving a word of direction now and then.

"Get these letters ready for me as soon as you can," he said. "I may
have to go to New York to-day. Call up Bainbridge and find out if he is
ready to talk business yet. Get Hetherington on the phone and see if
he has heard from that order he took yesterday, and send the boy up to
my home to get my suit case. He had better go as soon as he has those
envelopes addressed. There 'll be time."

When Matilda Herrick had taken her gaunt ability out of his private
office, he locked his door and went down on his knees beside his desk.
He was a young man who traveled under Guidance and went nowhere without
orders.

When he got up from his knees there was a look of purpose on his face
that had not been there before. He reached for his telephone and called
a number.

A hearty voice answered it promptly.

Whitney's face lighted with relief.

"Hello, Bert, is that you?"

"Sure is! Hello, Nell. Glad to hear your voice! How's crops?"

"Oh, growing, growing fast. Say, Bert, flying anywhere to-day?"

"Sure thing. Want to go?"

"If you're going in the right direction. What's your chart?"

"Wherever you say. You never thought you could spare the time to go
with me before."

"Happen to be going anywhere within a hundred miles of New York?"

"Flying right to Fifth Avenue, this afternoon, if you'll accompany me.
Got a bit of engine trouble to make right, it'll take a couple of hours
to fix, then I'm ready. How soon can you start?"

"I could make it any time after one if things go well here."

"Make it snappy and we'll paint New York red to-night."

"I'd prefer white, if you don't mind, Bert."

"O. K. with me Nellie, just so's you go along. Meet me at the field at
two o'clock."

Whitney hung up with an awed look in his face.

"It seems to be in the plan," he said to himself reverently, and began
to work at several matters of business that he knew must be set right
before he could honorably leave his own city.

It seemed beautiful to him the way everything worked out, no
hindrances, not a single hitch in the things that must be finished
before he left. Every man he called on the telephone was in, every
report of sales was such that he could give the important directions
concerning them before he went away.

"It's just as if somebody else was working with me to smooth the way,"
he thought.

The hours of the morning sped. Matilda Herrick had the letters ready
for signing in plenty of time. Everything went smoothly.

Nelson Whitney telephoned his mother to pack his suit case for a quick
trip, and the office boy did all the rest, including accompanying his
chief to the flying field, and driving the car back to the garage
again. At two-thirty exactly they were off, through the clear blue
ether, Nelson Whitney's first experience in flying.

For a few minutes the thrill of the new sensation occupied every
sense, but after he was accustomed to the thought of sailing with the
clouds, and looking down upon earth, he began to think of what was
before him in New York. Was this a wild-goose chase he was going on?
Wouldn't anybody, just anybody think he was a fool to start off with as
little warrant as he had had? Wasn't there danger of making his lady
everlastingly angry chasing her this way, even if he did find her?
Wouldn't even her mother have a right to resent it?

And what, pray, was he to do when he arrived in New York, beyond the
mere meeting the trains at the station, and getting in touch with
the people he was trying to help? How could he do that? Just walk up
smiling and say he knew they were expected so he met them? He hadn't
really any warrant for that. Of course he could say that Mary told him
what train they had taken, but he would feel like a fool saying that to
Mrs. Sheldon. Her keen eyes would see that there was something behind
it all, and perhaps she might resent his intrusion into her affairs,
though she had always acted, hitherto, as if he belonged to her scheme
of life.

And what could he do before her train arrived to keep Marguerite in
sight? If he met her train, she would be likely to be indignant. He
could not tell her he had found her note on the floor, and read it,
though it was addressed to her mother, and that he was here to protect
her from whatever evil, real or fancied, threatened her. Assuredly he
would meet her train and try to appear as casual as possible, but he
shrank inexpressibly from the look of scorn her dear eyes would cast at
him.

There was no question but that Marguerite would resent his entrance
onto the stage at this point in her career. She had been most haughty
and independent of late, and it stung him even to remember her careless
indifference.

And failing to get suitable touch with his girl at the train, if he
should go to hunt up that number of Fifth Avenue, and should find it
there, what would he do? And what if it were not there? And where lived
this Keller man who was apparently making all this trouble? Why! He
ought to have telephoned somebody and found that out before he left!
Here he was thinking he had done everything up in fine shape and he had
left out one of the strategic points in the whole matter. Of course he
could telephone back when he got to New York, but a lot of time might
be lost.

However, was he not traveling under guidance? Could not He who had
smoothed the way thus far manage it so that he would go to the right
place, do the right thing? Would not the way open as he advanced?
He had put himself under the guidance of the greatest Leader in the
universe, and there he must trust and not be afraid.

The silver wings that bore him above the earth flew straight on, over
wide stretches of the map. Sometimes he looked down wondering, when he
saw a railroad train creeping along like a small worm on the earth, if
perhaps he might be looking at the very train in which those he went to
protect were traveling.

The strange thing about it all was that though he was positive they
needed protection, he was not in the least sure from what he was
protecting them. Only in the case of the girl, if it should come about
that she tried to carry out her threat of marrying that man Keller,
he knew he must prevent it. He felt that it could be nothing short of
a calamity for her, to say nothing of her mother and himself, if that
should ever come to pass. He felt, too, that God was on his side, for
had he not put himself and his plans in the hands of God, willing to
be guided, willing to have all plans overturned if they were not the
right thing? And the way had been smoothed before him. Nothing had been
hindered of the least detail to stop him from going through the air.

So the silver wings flew on, and in due time Nelson Whitney arrived in
New York.

He did not help his friend in painting the town red. Instead he went
directly to the Pennsylvania station and got full details of all trains
arriving from the West. He found that Marguerite's train was due to
arrive late that evening. He begged off from going with his friend
longer than to dinner, and went straight back to the station where he
made himself well acquainted with the various exits of the train, and
found the best place to watch and await her.

It had not been hard to discover just where the train would come
in, and he had established himself behind the great iron bars just
above the train floor, where he could look down upon the disembarking
passengers without being seen by them unless they deliberately turned
around and looked up, but near enough to the train gate to get to her
at once if he should see she was in any need of a friend, or was at all
hesitant which way to turn.

During the long day, he had had full opportunity to plan what he would
say when he met her. He would tell how he had called at the house for
her list, and Mary had said she had gone to New York on the midnight
train. So when he was invited to fly with his friend to the same city,
he thought he would meet her train and ask her about the list, in case
he went back the next day. That was a perfectly reasonable story as
well as being absolutely true, for his friend had many times invited
him to fly, and had told him to call him when he could go.

Nevertheless he wished to reconnoiter before he approached her. It
was even conceivable that that Keller person might have somehow got
in touch with her, and be traveling with her. His blood boiled at the
thought, and he stood for twenty long minutes till the train arrived,
thinking over what he should do if that were the case. He decided that
he would in any event go to the gate and speak to Marguerite. It might
even be that a face from home might influence her, hinder her, from any
foolish thing she might be going to do. At least he would ask where she
was staying, and perhaps let her know that her mother was on the way,
just casually, as if of course she knew it.

He would be able to judge a great deal from the way she took what he
said.

In the mean time, while he mused, in not a little anxiety, forgetting
for the moment his Guide, the train came in. The stream of people like
ants, came filing up the iron stairs to the gateways, and not one of
them escaped the anxious eye of Nelson Whitney, as he stood in his
sheltered nook behind a bunch of train flags and gate signs and waited.

But Marguerite did not appear.

She did not even come up in the elevator, which was in full view from
his position. He was sure he had not missed her, yet a frenzy of
anxiety seized him. Perhaps she had seen him and had evaded him while
he was looking the other way!

Where was Marguerite?



CHAPTER IX

WHAT had happened to Marguerite was this.

She had never been to New York before, although she had traveled with
her father and mother now and then in other directions. She knew
nothing, of course, about the city save what she had gleaned from
occasional references to it in novels. When the porter of the Pullman
asked her before they reached Manhattan Transfer whether she was going
uptown or downtown she looked at him bewildered for an instant. Then
reasoning that an office building would likely be downtown, and she
wanted to be near to the place where she intended going the first thing
in the morning, she answered after that instant's hesitation,—

"Oh, yes, downtown. I'm going downtown."

"Then you get out at Manhattan Transfer, lady," said the porter eyeing
her a bit questioningly, she thought, because she had said downtown at
that time of night.

Manhattan Transfer looked wide and desolate and empty. There were
few passengers so late and there seemed to be no official in charge.
Marguerite stood aimlessly for a few minutes, looking this way and
that, wandering up, and then down, looking off at the dim distance of
stars and weird lights. Was this the great New York about which she had
heard so much?

But at last a train came. A brakeman on the step, swinging a lantern,
and yelling some unintelligible thing condescended to listen to her
plea.

"Where you wantta go, lady? Uptown or downtown?" The same mystical
question, and it must have been all wrong the way she answered it
before.

"Oh, I don't know which," she cried, almost in tears, for she was
suddenly realizing her lonely situation at this late hour. "I want to
go to a good respectable hotel."

"You go uptown lady, then. You get on the next train that comes by,
over that side of the platform; be 'long in five minutes now. Take you
to the Pennsylvania Station, good hotel right across the street. All
Aboard!"

And he swung away, leaving her more desolate than ever, for now the
wind-swept platform was empty of the few travelers who had been waiting
for this train, and Marguerite dared not go in search of any official
who might be inside the shelters lest she miss her train. Thus it was
that she arrived at the great station almost an hour later than the
train by which she should have come. Emerging into the gloom, and
climbing the midnight stairs into the wide upper area, she felt smaller
and more alone even than when she had stood on the high barren sweep of
Manhattan Transfer.

There was noise and light here, a blare of it, and a strange midnight
clatter that frightened her.

If it had not been for a kindly agent of the Traveller's Aid who
happened by just as she emerged from the iron gate, and said, noting
her hesitancy, "Can I help you?" she might have stood there all night
perhaps, afraid to venture into that vast empty floor like a little
vessel setting sail to an unknown port.

But the friendly Traveller's Aid soon had the weary girl safely
established in the great hotel across the way, and possessed of all the
information she needed to get herself to the desired number on Fifth
Avenue in the morning.

Mind and body cannot continue forever in a state of violent emotion
without some rest, and Marguerite, finding herself at last in a quiet
room with a luxurious bed, and nothing she could possibly do until
morning, succumbed to her weariness and fell into a deep sleep.

She intended quite fully to waken about seven o'clock, get herself
in readiness for her errand, and then try to get in touch with Rufus
Keller. She thought she had a pretty good idea where to telegraph him,
and felt that if she did so, it would only be a matter of a few hours
before she had word that he was coming to her at once.

She was not well enough versed in the ways of travelers to leave an
order at the hotel desk to have them call her at seven, and if she had
been, she would have been too confident that it was unnecessary. She
had prided herself for years on her ability to set herself to waken any
time at all, and never fail to waken on the minute. However that was,
it turned out that she slept on straight past seven, past eight, past
nine, past ten, past eleven, and never wakened till quarter to twelve
o'clock, dazed and vague as to where she was or why she was there.

Meantime at ten o'clock Mary Dunlap and Mrs. Sheldon arrived in the
city, and took their way briskly, attended by a porter carrying their
luggage, straight through the tiled tunnel and into the Pennsylvania
Hotel, where they were given a room one floor below where Marguerite
slept her exhausted sleep.

"We had better not wait for anything," said Marguerite's mother
anxiously, giving a push and a pat to the straggling locks about her
temples and walking nervously toward the door.

"My dear, you are going to have a cup of coffee before we stir a step,"
said Mary Dunlap firmly. "I told the boy as we came up in the elevator
to have it sent up at once and it's not going to take three minutes
to drink it. I tell you nothing is doing in New York until ten, and
she can't get away right at once. There is no use running risks. You
are going on your nerve, and that might give out at the wrong time and
spoil everything. There, he is knocking now. Sit down and drink it.
Then we'll call a taxi and be there in no time! It is quite early yet
and I'm positive Mr. Oliver—I mean Keller—never goes down to his office
before half past ten at the earliest."

But Nelson Whitney had not been able to sleep. He had laid himself
properly in bed of course and closed his eyes. He had committed himself
and his wishes and his girl to the care of One who was infinitely
powerful, infinitely able, infinitely willing to bring order out of
confusion, and he was resting on that; but he lay there staring into
the night and facing a thing that might be coming to him on the morrow.
Supposing he should find that Marguerite had already gone to that other
man, and that, unworthy though he believed him to be, she was now
irrevocably committed to him, for better, for worse. Could he give up
his will in the matter, his joy, his very life, and give up his girl to
a sorrow he felt was inevitable if she married Keller?

Whitney did not oversleep. He arose far earlier than he had set himself
to be about. He tried to eat some breakfast, but it was as dust and
ashes in his mouth. He went out to walk, but the exercise was merely
mechanical. He did not see the buildings he passed, nor notice anybody
on the street. He was going over the probable program for the morning,
trying to decide which thing he should do first.

If he went to the train to meet Mrs. Sheldon, he would be late in
getting to Fifth Avenue when Marguerite would be likely to be arriving.
If he went to Fifth Avenue first, he would be too late to meet the
train. He finally decided that it was more important to find Marguerite
than her mother, for the mother would communicate with Mary at home as
soon as she located in a hotel and if he found Marguerite, he could
telephone to Mary and have little trouble in locating Mrs. Sheldon
afterward. Marguerite was of course the first consideration.

He had no trouble in finding the number on the avenue that had been
indicated in Marguerite's note, and was somewhat reassured, but also
not a little troubled to find the name, "R. H. Oliver, Manager," in
gold letters on the rich glass of the heavy mahogany door. Just what
effect would it have upon the girl who had taken this wild midnight
journey to prove there was no such person? He pondered this as he
sought out the janitor and asked a few questions about the usual hour
of opening the offices in that building.

He was still pondering it as he set out to walk a regular beat, up the
avenue, across the street, down the avenue, across and back again,
varying it occasionally by a quick detour into one of the side streets
where he turned about and returned the other way. He did not care to
be noticed, as he kept his anxious vigil. As the minutes passed into
an hour and then dropped into long minutes again, his heart sank with
the fear lest after all somehow he had missed her. Perhaps she had come
down to the office building ahead of him, or perhaps she had looked up
the name in the city directory, discovered that it really was there,
and had changed her course. Why had he not thought of that before? Yet
what else could he have done than he had done? He had no clue but this,
and must follow it to its reasonable end.

There were not many people on that part of the avenue so early, and
he had no difficulty in getting a good look at each one. He felt
reasonably certain that she could not have got by since he had arrived,
so he tramped back and forth like a lion in a cage, not daring to go
beyond the bounds he had set himself lest somehow she escape him. The
thought that was aching into his heart now was what possible connection
could there be between this man Oliver and the fellow Keller whom his
girl had declared her intention of marrying after she had proved that
there was no such person as Oliver?

A dim possibility was stealing through his mental turbulence, but
he rejected such an explanation of the situation, as unworthy of a
decent man to think about another, even about one whom he distrusted.
Yet again and again it recurred. Had someone been trying to make his
little girl see that the man with whom she seemed to be infatuated was
unworthy of her? Had she set out to disprove what they had told her? It
must be something of that sort of course, but what?

By the time that he had tramped nearly two hours away in anxious
watching, he was in a mood to wish he could get his hands on this
Keller man and give him a good thrashing. He felt more and more
confident that he deserved it, even though he might be none of the
unworthy kinds of villain that his imagination had been conjuring.

It was still five minutes to the hour the janitor had mentioned as
opening time for offices when he finally tramped back to the building
and entered the elevator. He had considered staying outside in the
street till he saw Marguerite arrive, but rejected the idea as futile.
She would be very likely to see him if he came too near, and perhaps
evade him, for it was most likely that she wanted none of her friends
with her on this expedition, else she would surely have confided in her
mother.

He had considered also secreting himself somewhere in the hallway, at a
good vantage point to watch for her, if there were such a hiding place,
but rejected that idea also, because if anything was going to happen,
he wanted to be there to see what it was. He felt that it was his right
to understand the case, seeing he was going to try to help Marguerite.
How else could he know whether or not he might be intruding where even
angels should not tread? No, he must be in the office, and well placed
where she would not notice him, or he might never find out whether
he even had a right to try to help her. He must fathom this mystery
himself. It was not anything Marguerite's mother could tell him, else
he felt sure she would have called for him in the middle of the night
even, to accompany her and help her in her trouble. That it was a
terrible trouble to the mother he had no doubt.

He had a bad half minute when several young women came hurriedly into
the hall and rushed for the elevator. Perhaps she was among them, and
this would be by no means the place he had planned to meet Marguerite,
in the elevator!

But the young women were none of them the girl he sought; they were
obviously secretaries hastening to their various jobs, and he drew an
involuntary breath of relief as the elevator shot up to the floor to
which he was going. The young women all got out at different stops by
the way.

He was glad that he was the only one in the elevator when it stopped at
the ninth floor, and he could get off and take his bearings once more
without observation. Then he noticed that the door of R. H. Oliver's
office was standing ajar, and with quickened pulse he hurried down the
hall.



CHAPTER X

NELSON WHITNEY pushed the door of R. H. Oliver's office open quickly
and stepped within with an air of stealthy triumph. He looked around
furtively with keen eyes, half fearful at what he might see.

But there was no one there but an elderly girl taking off her hat and
coat at the back of the room. She hung them on a couple of pegs in a
shadowy corner, patted her hair into prim shape before a small mirror,
and put a last dab of powder on a thin angular nose. He paused and
watched her uncertainly.

"Is Mr. Oliver in yet?" he asked as she turned inquiringly and came
toward him, her folded gloves and a large flat purse in her hand.

"Oh, no!" she said with a tang of amusement in her voice that set him
down for a country ninny. She glanced at the clock. "He never gets down
before half past if he does then."

Whitney cast a quick searching gaze around the room once more, as if
perchance the girl he sought might be hiding somewhere in the shadows.

"Mind if I wait here?" he asked, ignoring the contempt in the girl's
voice.

"Help yourself," said the girl in a chilly tone.

She unlocked the desk, and slung a typewriter out into the open from
some hidden recess, laid her pocketbook and gloves in a drawer, took
out a dust cloth and proceeded to polish her desk and clean her
typewriter. She had the appearance of not even remembering that the
young man existed. Presently she began to hum a jazzy little radio tune
to further shut him out of her immediate circle.

This just suited Whitney. He deliberately took in every corner of the
room, the beautiful furniture and the rich Oriental rug, and selected
a shadowy alcove behind the main door, facing toward the windows on
the other side of the room. It was a dark little corner, gloomy in
fact, the alcove being formed by the ground glass partition of an inner
office that ran out from the main wall ten feet and then down to the
back of the room. The angle of these walls would partly hide him, even
from the girl at her desk which stood well out in the middle of the
room. The gloom of the corner would not call attention to his presence.

He drew a carved walnut chair into the right position to give him a
view of the room and yet not bring him into notice and sat down. After
a calm minute or two, he unfurled a morning paper which he could not
possibly have read to advantage in the dim light, and prepared to hide
behind it at the approach of footsteps. Surely he ought to be able to
remain incognito here, for a while at least till matters developed,
seeing that none of the people who were likely to have a part in the
little drama about to be played had the slightest idea that he was in
that part of the country. They would scarcely recognize his shoes and
trousers, nor his hands, and that was all that the paper and the gloom
would reveal. He would just sit quietly here and see what happened.

The secretary finished her morning cleaning and began typing some
letters. The minutes ticked slowly by on the magnificent mahogany
grandfather clock that stood six feet against the opposite wall between
the two high windows. Nelson Whitney began to tell himself that he was
a fool, and had come on a fool's errand. Probably nobody would come at
all that he expected. Probably the morning would go by, and the man
Oliver would arrive and he wouldn't even know him from any other man,
let alone knowing what to say to him.

For the next five minutes he busied himself planning what errand he
might possibly have for visiting an unknown man in his office. A
perusal of the ground glass door into the hall did not help him. It
bore over Oliver's name the legend "Ransom, Oliver, Bates and Company"
nothing more. He did not know whether they sold bonds or automobiles
or insurance. They might be almost anything. There wasn't a scratch of
anything in the room that he could see that would give the slightest
clue. There was nothing on the wall within his vision but a framed
etching of old New York.

What should he do? Should he say he was waiting for friends who were
to meet him there? Should he tell the man when he arrived that he must
have come to the wrong address? It seemed that he would appear a fool
in almost anything he might say, yet he held his ground and sat behind
his paper trying to frame a reasonable excuse for his presence. He
decided that he might perhaps ask if the man wanted to employ a helper.
There was Jack Rector at home who was crazy to get a job in New York.
Yet what kind of a job would this be? Something that could be sold?
Jack would make a keen young salesman.

The minutes dragged on. The secretary typed incessantly and paid no
more attention to him than if he had been an empty chair. The room was
as still as an empty cell, sealed from the roar and rumble of the city
noises.

Nelson Whitney was still pondering possibilities when there came at
last the clang of an elevator, and steps, leisurely steps, outside the
door. His heart stood still and then leaped forward in great bounds for
it was a woman's step. Had the moment arrived at last? And if his girl
should see him, how would she take it? Would she think he, too, was in
league against her and be angry? He withdrew still further into the
depths of his paper, and the door swung open and admitted a lady.

The secretary jumped up, all smiles.

"Oh, good morning Mrs. Oliver! Aren't you downtown early? Didn't Mr.
Oliver come with you? I thought he was expecting to be in the office
this morning. There are some checks for him to sign."

Whitney lowered his paper and saw a woman about forty years old, a
sweet-faced woman with a lovely smile, and faultlessly dressed.

"Good morning, Miss Flinch," she said pleasantly. "Why, no, Mr. Oliver
and Katharine came down earlier. Hasn't he come yet? He said he would
surely be here by this time. I expected to find him in his office hard
at work, or else ready to chide me for being ten minutes later than I
promised. I was waiting for Gloria. She was to drive back with the car
and get me, but she telephoned that they had a flat tire, and she would
meet me here. Hasn't she come yet either?"

"No, Mrs. Oliver. But I guess they'll be here presently," assured the
secretary.

"Of course," said the lady. "Well, I'll just step into Mr. Oliver's
office and write a note. I was afraid I wouldn't have time to write it
at home, but it really ought to go."

The secretary smiled and the lady retreated through the ground glass
door of the inner office. The typewriter clicked on.

The clang of the elevator was becoming more frequent now, and there
were more and more footsteps going down the marble corridor. Whitney
scarcely realized that the hall door had opened again until he heard a
woman's clear voice speaking to the secretary.

"Has Mr. Oliver come in yet?"

"No," said the secretary severely.

"How soon do you expect him?"

"Almost any time now," said his keeper ungraciously. "Did you have an
appointment?"

"No," said the woman, "but he knows me well."

"He's very busy this morning," interrupted the secretary. "He's been
away for three weeks and there are a lot of things for him to attend
to. I don't know if he'll have time to see anybody," and she cast a
belligerent look toward the newspaper and the legs over in the gloomy
alcove.

"Don't worry," said the dominant voice of Mrs. Dunlap pleasantly, "I
shall not keep him a second. I merely want him to endorse a check for
me. I'm a personal friend. I'll just wait till he comes."

The secretary looked as if she thought that was a doubtful statement,
but she assented silently and went on typing.

Whitney wondered what there was about that voice that reminded him of
something recent? He lowered his paper and shot a glance at the woman
and then he saw there was another with her, a quiet, shrinking woman
with gray hair, and a sweet profile that he had known all his life. And
the other one was the woman that had been calling on Mrs. Sheldon when
he went to see Marguerite!

Well, at least he would not have to search for them. They were here.
Now, what should he do? Reveal himself to them at once and try to
make some plan? But no—there were more footsteps coming that way,
and the clang of the elevator continually now. It would not do to be
caught saying good morning to them if Marguerite should walk in. And
besides—just what should he say how explain his presence there? Should
he confess that he had read a letter that was not intended for his
eyes? Strange he had not remembered to think that all out and have some
plan. He had had all night to plan it and he had not done it.

The two women had stood hesitating a moment by the desk, but Mrs.
Dunlap went into action as Whitney stole a glance over his paper.

"Let's sit over here by the window," she said in a tone as if she were
quite at home.

She went to the corner she had indicated and whirled the chairs about
so that they would face away from the room, and put their occupants
with their backs toward anyone entering. But Mrs. Sheldon did not
follow immediately. She lingered hesitantly by the desk an instant
longer, a worried wistful look in her sweet eyes.

"My—daughter—hasn't come in yet, has she?" she hazarded. "She was
to—that is, she was expecting—I mean we expected to meet her here."

She glanced apologetically toward her companion, and then back
wistfully to the secretary.

"Nobody been in this morning but that man," said the secretary still
ungraciously, indicating with a sweep of her capable white hand the
legs in the alcove surmounted by the newspaper.

Daisy's mother gave a quick frightened glance toward the alcove without
realizing that those legs had often been a familiar sight in her house.
She retreated half frightened to the chair Mrs. Dunlap smilingly
offered, and the two women sank down quietly with two magazines that
Mrs. Dunlap produced from the window seat. Again the click of the
typewriter was the only sound that was heard.

The postman came in presently and left a great stack of mail which gave
the secretary a rest from her typing while she went resolutely through
the letters, sorting them into piles.

There were many footsteps going down the corridor now, and the three
whose hearts were listening for a certain step, could not be certain at
all. The mother started nervously whenever any one approached the door.

The elevator was clanging incessantly. Presently a nervous step came
down the corridor, almost breathlessly, as if the owner had hurried,
then hesitated a moment in front of the door. The knob turned, slowly,
almost timidly.

Somehow Whitney knew that step—knew in his heart that she had come
at last, and felt the horror that would be in her white face as she
discovered the name she had come to disprove shining golden in the
noonday light. The paper in his hand trembled and he dared to peer
around it at the little white frightened, almost belligerent face of
the girl he loved.

She stood in the doorway for an instant and swept the room with her
glance, not carefully for she was too nervous, and she was not looking
for people from home. Whitney was at one side, almost behind her now,
for she was standing in the middle of the room wide-eyed, and she had
scarcely noticed the backs of the two women shrinking into their chairs
in the window corner earnestly reading magazines.

She went straight up to the desk and her voice trembled a little as she
asked her questions.

"Is this Mr. R. H. Oliver's office?"

Miss Flinch surveyed her impersonally before she nodded.

"May I see him at once?" asked Marguerite, growing more certain of
herself now, and speaking excitedly.

"He isn't here yet."

"Not here?" the little catch in Marguerite's voice could be heard
around the room. "How soon will he be in? I've got to catch a Western
train and there's only three quarters of an hour."

"I can't say when he'll be in," said the secretary regarding her
indifferently. "It might be in five minutes, it might be half an hour."

"But you're sure he is coming? This morning?"

"Positive," said the laconic secretary. "His wife's in the private
office waiting for him now. There's all these people waiting to see
him, and he's awfully busy besides. He's got to sign a lot of letters
and meet two men at one o'clock, and he's taking his wife and children
off for a holiday. If that isn't a full day, I don't know where you
come in. But you can sit down and wait if you think there's any chance
for you."

"Oh, I won't keep him but an instant. If I can just see him!"

The secretary waved her to a chair.

"You'll have to take your turn," she warned her.

Marguerite cast a swift appraising glance around the room, at the two
huddled figures in the chairs by the window, two oldish backs upon whom
her glance scarcely rested and a pair of gentlemanly legs surmounted by
a newspaper. Strangers in a land that was strange to her, what could
they mean to her but hindrances to her completed race? It was hours
later than she had meant to be, and she ought to get out of New York,
and away to seek her beloved.

She knew that her mother would presently stir up something. She was not
a woman to lie idly by and see her only daughter lost in the world,
with an undesirable marriage in the offing. She would presently set
something going somehow to hinder. Her mother was never balked when
the welfare of one beloved was concerned. She simply must get a train
right away as soon as she had seen this man. Of course he would not be
the right one. Of course that lying Mrs. Dunlap had merely given the
name of some one she knew as a bluff to gain her point. And as soon as
she laid eyes on the man and saw he was not anyone she had ever seen
before, she would apologize pleasantly, say she must have the wrong
address, and depart.

While she was dressing she had remembered a way to find Rufus. She
would get that minister friend of his that was to have married them, on
the long distance telephone, and find out how best to reach him. The
rest would be easy of course. Then she would get away from New York as
fast as possible, somewhere, anywhere, it didn't matter much, just a
little way, so she could not be traced, and then get off and telephone
Rufus. She would plan to meet him wherever he said and be married at
once. Perhaps she might even suggest this to the minister friend of
his when she found the address, just say they were going to be married
at once, that all difficulties had been cleared away or something like
that.

How fortunate it was that she remembered the name and address of that
minister so well. She had watched Rufus writing out the telegram as he
argued, and he had written Rev. Lee Spencer, D.D. so beautifully. He
had a wonderful, bold way of writing that thrilled her to watch, it
seemed so masterful!

All these thoughts went racing through Marguerite's mind as she dropped
into a chair near the desk facing the entrance, her eyes glued to the
door that she might get the first glimpse of the man as he entered.

Mrs. Dunlap half leaned over toward Mrs. Sheldon to whisper, and then
thought better of it. They exchanged lifted eyebrows, and a question
stood in their eyes for an instant. Then suddenly a quick eager young
step came rushing down the corridor. The door opened with a rush and
closed with a bang as a slim pretty girl entered panting as if she had
run up several flights of stairs.

"Oh, Miss Flinch," she gasped, "has Daddy come yet? I've simply ruined
myself running up all the stairs. I couldn't wait for the elevator. I
was afraid Dad and Mother wouldn't wait for me. Oh hasn't he come yet?
Oh, I'm glad! But Muth is here isn't she? I thought she would be. I
telephoned her I had a flat tire, and I had to leave the tiresome old
car in a garage away uptown, and walk three blocks to get a bus, and
then it didn't come forever and an age. The bus service in this town is
the limit isn't it? Did you say Muth was here?"

"Yes, Miss Gloria, she came half an hour ago. She's in your father's
office writing a letter."

"Oh, I know. She said it simply had to go or she couldn't go with
us. You know, Miss Flinch, it's her birthday, and Daddy came home
especially for it. We're going off on a spree. Daddy won't tell us
where, but we're going in the new car, and it's to be a surprise party
for us all. Muth doesn't even know which way we are taking.

"But I can't think what's keeping Daddy and Katharine. You know, Miss
Flinch," Gloria lowered her voice with a glance toward the ground glass
partition, "they've gone to get her present. She doesn't know a thing
about it of course. Katharine picked it out weeks ago and she and I
had it put away till Daddy would get back. We knew he'd love it for
her, and I know it's just what she wants. It's a platinum wristwatch
and bracelet with diamonds and sapphires all set around the edge. Oh,
it's perfectly darling. She'll show it to you of course. But I'm just
dying to see what she says when he gives it to her. Oh, dear! Why don't
they come? I do hope there isn't some stupid old mistake. Perhaps some
dumbbell of a salesman has sold it to someone else. Wouldn't that
simply be unbearable? Perhaps they've had to hunt around for another.
But I never saw any as precious as this one."

"I wouldn't worry, Miss Gloria," said the secretary fondly. "They've
likely been delayed in traffic. There! There's the elevator! Maybe
they're coming now. Yes, I think that's Mr. Oliver's step."

"Oh, it is, it is! The day is saved," cried Gloria tragically.

The door opened and another very pretty girl scarcely older than the
first entered, and behind her a gentleman.

"There! Daddy! You're late yourself. I've won the bet and you've got
to pay up! A five-pound box of chocolates! Remember! You promised! And
a new pair of slippers for the party! Muth and I've been here a long
time—and I had a flat tire, too, and a lot of trouble."

The gentleman stepped in and closed the door, gave a quick glance at
the legs and the newspaper in the alcove, another toward the window
where huddled the two women, and then faced toward the desk where
for the instant his two daughters had so grouped themselves as to
completely hide the white-faced girl from his vision.

Gloria boomed forth again:

"Now, Daddy, you've simply got to come into the office and show it to
her at once. I can't wait another second. I'm dying to see what she
thinks of it. Come on in now before Miss Flinch gets you into a lot of
tiresome checks and letters you have to sign. Come on, Daddy it won't
take long, and then Muth can enjoy it while she waits."

Gloria caught his hands and pulled him toward the door of the inner
office, and Katharine moved to follow, when suddenly the man saw the
white-faced girl. She had risen from her seat, and exclaimed eagerly,
pleadingly, as if somehow the sight of her eyes, the hearing of her
ears had deceived her, and this was some horrible dream which would
presently be explained:

"Rufus! Oh Rufus—I've come—!"

The man turned ashen color, and looked as if he were going to drop.
He stopped where he stood, apparently unable to move further, feebly
drawing his hands away from the eager girls who kept trying to draw him
on.

"Go! Go!" he said to them in a voice that sounded more like a croak.
"Go to your mother! I'll come in a moment!"

There was something in his voice that made the girls obey, though
reluctantly.

"What is the matter now?" murmured Gloria, impatiently. "Didn't you get
it? Didn't he like it, Kath?"

"Yes, and he's crazy about it. I'm sure I don't know what's the matter.
Some tiresome old business probably. It's always that way."

As the inner door closed on them, Gloria's perplexed voice asked:

"What did that girl mean 'Rufus'?"



CHAPTER XI

IT WAS Mrs. Dunlap who took command of the situation, stepping into the
picture at exactly the most awful moment of revelation when several
lives seemed about to fall into chaos.

"Oh, Mr. Oliver," she said in her pleasant, commanding tone coming
forward with a fountain pen and a bit of blue paper in her hand, until
she stood exactly before the shrinking girl, and the ghastly man, "Good
morning! I won't detain you but an instant. I just stepped in to ask
if you would kindly endorse this check for me so that I can cash it. I
found myself suddenly out of money, and near your office, and I knew
you would help me out."

She held out the check and pen, and the desperate man reached for
them as a drowning man would reach for a rope flung out to him. He
even tried to summon a smile of graciousness to his stiff lips, and
naturalness to his voice as he assented:

"Why, certainly, Mrs. Dunlap—I'm—delighted to be able to do anything
for you."

There was a high-strained quality to his voice and his attempt at a
laugh was a decided failure. His hand was shaking, as he wrote his
name, Ralph H. Oliver across the back of the check. It was an old
blank one which Mrs. Dunlap had carried with her in her purse for
several months in case of emergency. That morning she had made it out
to herself, signed with her maiden name and endorsed it. But the man
who endorsed it again was not even noticing whether it was a check
or not. He was only bestirring his clever brain to get him out of
this situation, and by the time the name was written, he had made his
decision. He would ignore this girl, and get himself out of the room at
once, and out of the building, even if he was obliged to emerge through
the tenth-story window to the street. Anything no matter how ghastly,
was better than what would probably happen if he remained.

He swung himself around to face Mrs. Dunlap, and put Marguerite out of
range, as he handed over the check with a hand that was shaking visibly.

Again the stiffening lips wrinkled themselves into a ghastly semblance
of a smile as he spoke, his manner an attempt at the debonair:

"Mrs. Dunlap, I think my wife is in my private office, and she will
never forgive me if I do not call her. She will want to see you if only
for a moment. Let me go and call her."

"Oh, I'll call her, Mr. Oliver!" said the secretary eagerly, half
rising from her desk.

"No, no, Miss Flinch. I'll call her myself. I want you to get those
letters out before the next mail please. It is very imperative. I'll
just call her."

"Indeed, Mr. Oliver, I cannot possibly wait a moment," interrupted
Mrs. Dunlap. "Tell Mrs. Oliver for me that I am returning this way in
a week or two and I will call her up and make an appointment to see
her. But now I really must hasten away. I have friends here with me
who are in haste. By the way, of course you know them." She stepped
back and turned toward Mrs. Sheldon who had risen and come forward,
her eyes stern, her face full of indignation and dislike. "My friend
Mrs. Sheldon. I think you have already met in her home town and Miss
Sheldon, her daughter? And now we mustn't keep you an instant."

Nelson Whitney had long ago discarded the enveloping newspaper and
was on his feet, standing in the shadow of the alcove, with eyes only
for the white-faced girl. When the others stepped before her and hid
his vision, he came forward into the light, forgetting that he did
not intend to reveal his identity just now, forgetting everything but
that the beloved eyes were filled with sudden awful comprehension, and
agony, the beloved lips were trembling visibly, and his darling looked
like a white lily stricken and about to fall.

Sudden revelation had made him, too, wise as to the situation; for
when Mr. Ralph Oliver turned to hand Mrs. Dunlap the endorsed check,
the light from the windows fell full upon his ashen face, and Whitney
recognized him at once as Rufus Keller, and the whole dastardly truth
burst upon him. For an instant his desire to take the scoundrel by
the collar and thrash him, or fling him from the room almost overcame
him, as he took another step forward; and then suddenly a new element
entered the scene in the appearance of the two girls and their mother
from the inner office!

A wave of utter fear that passed over the face of Oliver, gave Whitney
quick comprehension once more, and he saw suddenly what sorrow it would
mean to these other innocent ones, as well as to his dear girl, if
further revelations were made at that moment. Not for a second would
he have hesitated for the sake of the villain, for he deserved every
inch of punishment that was coming to him; but even in this crisis, it
came to Nelson Whitney like a flash that there was one who had said,
"Vengeance is Mine!"

Who was he to judge this cringing soul, and bring sorrow to these
trusting other ones? Therefore he stopped where he stood, just behind
the man who had done his best to shatter the joy of at least four
lives, and waited. He was not even aware that he had come out of his
hiding, or that his presence would presently need explanation. He just
stood there as if he had been called to place by some higher power than
himself, ready for the moment when he would be needed.

Oliver was a clever man, a cunning actor, else he could not so long
have deceived those who loved him. He was quick to clutch again at the
slender rope thrown out to him. With a suave distant manner, not too
gracious, he acknowledged the introduction, standing where he was, and
giving them but a polite lifting of the eyelids that swept them both in
a cold distant glance:

"I believe we have met before—Winfield, was it? Or one of those little
towns out that way? I am traveling so much and meeting so many—"

Nelson Whitney marveled at the colossal assurance that could speak such
words so coolly, and then his attention was suddenly drawn to Mrs.
Sheldon. She had drawn her sweet patrician dignity up about her as a
garment, and seemed to stand fully two inches taller than her usual
height, as she looked straight into the eyes of the man who had tried
to deceive her only daughter. There was an instant's pause, as if her
eyes could say to him all that her lips had been forbidden for the sake
of others to do, and then her voice broke into clear contempt as she
said:

"And our friend Mr. Whitney, Nelson Whitney of Wellsburgh! I think you
have met him also, Mr.—Oliver?"

It was a masterly stroke, and conveyed to the wretched man all that a
woman of Mrs. Sheldon's birth and breeding could never have said in
words.

Oliver wheeled and faced Whitney, a look of genuine fright in his eyes.
Just a flash, and then he turned quickly back and waved toward the
three who were advancing eagerly from the office door:

"Here comes my wife now, and my daughters. I knew they would be
delighted to see you. Mrs. Dunlap, will you do the honors and excuse me
just a moment? There is a telegram I must send at once!" he glanced at
his watch. "I had forgotten it."

He turned furtively, and Nelson Whitney was reminded of his dog at home
who when he was reproved was in the habit of stealing from the room,
half crouched, his tail between his legs, and stealthily looking back
as he slithered out of the room.

So Ralph Oliver slunk from the room into his inner office, and locked
the door. The keen ears of Mrs. Dunlap heard the grate of the key.

Yet before he had fairly turned away from them, the room was thrilled
with a clear voice:

"We really ought all to go at once. Nelson and I have been planning to
see Grant's Tomb and the Museum. Will you take me there now, Nelson?"

It was Marguerite, the old sweet challenge of her friendly voice
startling him into life once more. It was more than an appeal. It was
as if she went back ten years to their childhood days when they had
planned to see all the wonders of the world together. It had been a
long time since she had appealed to him for anything, and his heart
leaped high with joy. Take her to the Museum? Yes, take her to the
world's end if she chose!

He took two good steps and was beside her, drawing her arm within his,
and so together they acknowledged the introduction to a scoundrel's
lovely wife and daughters, with which Mrs. Dunlap noisily and
skillfully covered the retreat of the enemy, the victory completely
in her own hands. There was even a lilt in her voice as she told Mrs.
Oliver what a dear woman Mrs. Sheldon was; although her heart was
aching with mother love as she saw the brave white anguish which the
victim was showing as she held up her head and stood her ground, her
knees were shaking under her.

Mrs. Sheldon took the hand of the other mother, and said with a warmth
of feeling strangely keen for a mere acquaintance.

"I have wanted to meet you. I have heard such beautiful things about
you, and now I see that they are all justified."

Nelson Whitney saw that the little gloved hand on his arm was
fluttering as if in ague, and tenderly he laid a strong hand
possessively over it, and took the burden of the conversation as the
introduction came their way, leaving nothing for his dear girl to do
but try to smile.

That she did it bravely and well, and that the strangers did not
suspect her state of mind was shown by the comments of Gloria later,
when, the telegrams all sent, the letters dictated, and the checks
signed, they started in the new car on their delayed holiday, several
hours late by the new watch flashing on Mrs. Oliver's beautiful wrist.

"Wasn't that girl perfectly darling!" she said to her sister. "She has
a face like Muth's cameo pin, and the way she looked at her sweetheart
was just too dear!"

"How do you know he was her sweetheart? She may have a dozen others,"
said the wiser Katharine.

"No, I'm positive. Didn't you see how he put his hand over hers right
there in the office before us? And she let him. She isn't the kind of
girl that lets a man do things like that unless she's engaged to him.
My! But his eyes were handsome. He looked down at her as if he just
could eat her. Well, I don't blame him. She is sweet. She's precious! I
wish she lived where we could know her. I've got a crush on her myself,
and I think he's a humdinger. I'd like to be bridesmaid at the wedding!"

Said R. H. Oliver suddenly as he yanked his car out of swift collision
with a truck:

"Gloria, I wish you wouldn't talk any more if you've got to converse
like a fool! For heaven's sake stop it!"

Just what heaven had to do with her guileless chatter Gloria didn't
understand, but she knew when her father spoke in that tone it was
time to cease, so Gloria sat back and dreamed of a day when a knight
similar to Nelson Whitney would come riding her way, and hold her own
fluttering hand, and look into her thrilled eyes, and carry her off
into a world of loveliness.

Nelson Whitney led his beloved out of that office just as soon as the
law of politeness allowed.

Just an instant, he had paused beside Mrs. Sheldon as he passed her.

"Is there any special time when you would like to have us meet you at
the hotel?" he asked in an undertone.

But it was Mrs. Dunlap who heard and who handed him a card upon which
she had been scribbling.

"Any time you like," she said in a tone for his ears alone. "Mrs.
Sheldon needs to rest, and I'll see that she does. Just ring up the
room when you get back and let us know the program. I'll stay till you
get back at least."

He glanced at the card. On it was written the name of the hotel and
the number of their room. A fleeting smile went over his face. Here
those two good ladies had come straight to the same hotel where
he was. He had had no need to worry at all with such a Guide. Why
hadn't he remembered that God was able to work out things without his
interference, able to make the crooked places straight, and the dark
things plain in His own good time!



CHAPTER XII

WHEN Mrs. Sheldon had turned from speaking with Mrs. Oliver and her two
charming daughters, she looked around the office in dismay.

"Why, where is Marguerite?" she asked with instant worry in her eyes.
"She hasn't gone away?" and there was in her voice that quality of
desperation which had made Mrs. Dunlap fear for her health more than
once in the hours they had spent together.

She hastened to assure her.

"It's all right, Mrs. Sheldon. She's with Nelson Whitney. They've gone
off together to do some sight seeing I think."

"But they don't know where we are that is they won't know how to find
us. Nelson didn't—that is Marguerite won't—" She stopped in confusion,
realizing that this would seem very strange talk to the onlooking
Olivers about people who were supposed to be of the same party.

But Mrs. Dunlap was equal to the occasion.

"It's all right, my dear. I told them where we were going, wrote it
down for them so they wouldn't make a mistake."

With relief, the weary mother relaxed the drawn look of her face and
turned to the Olivers graciously.

"I'm so glad to have met you," she said, and smiled sincerely.

When they were gone Gloria turned to her mother.

"I didn't like the way she spoke to you, Mums dear!" she said. "It was
almost as if she felt sorry for you somehow."

"What a queer idea!" laughed her mother. "I think she is a very
charming woman. In fact anybody Mrs. Dunlap sponsors usually is."

"Yourself included, Mums!" laughed Gloria. "Come on Muth, lets rout out
Dad and get started. We're two hours behind schedule now. Kath, you
ought to have run things better than this!" And laughing they went off
to find the beloved husband and father.

They found him standing by the window with the sash thrown up, wiping
beads of perspiration from his forehead, though the day was keen and
clear.

"What's the matter, dear? Is there any trouble about your business?"
asked Mrs. Oliver solicitously.

"I wasn't feeling very well there for a minute!" said the valiant
husband, mopping his cold brow once more. "I felt a little dizzy!
I guess I've been going it a little too hard lately. I suppose I'm
getting old."

He paused for his loving family to refute this statement, but they only
laughed as if it were a good joke.

"I think I'll have to cut out some of this traveling," he said slowly,
taking deep breaths between his words. He still wore a sort of whipped
look except to his family's eyes.

But at that they all shouted a joyous assent, "Yes, Dad, that would be
great! Then you'd be all ours and not belong to the world at large any
more," added Gloria as the hurrah subsided.

"Come on, let's go!" said Oliver turning away from them quickly to hide
a look of something like shame that stole over his scared white face.

"But we haven't given Muth her presents yet," reminded Gloria who never
by any chance forgot anything.

It was with relief that Oliver took the little white box containing the
watch from his pocket. The attention all focused upon it, instead of
himself, he was able even to make a pleasant little flowery speech in
presentation.

Nevertheless the occasion had ceased to be the joyous celebration that
he had anticipated. Half of his mind was necessarily occupied with
wondering what on earth that Dunlap woman meant to do next? Did she
intend to keep that miserable affair of Daisy hanging over his head
like a Damoclean sword the rest of his natural life? If so, there would
be no peace anywhere.

He would never know when they might walk in and bring him to shame
among his friends. Well, he had been a fool of course. It was hard to
admit it. Perhaps he had merely bungled things. But—yes, he felt a
good deal of a fool. After all, what was that girl but a pretty pink
and white thing—just a passing fancy. Home was best. He would stay at
home—unless that obnoxious Mrs. Dunlap was going to haunt his steps.

Perhaps it would be as well to go abroad for a year. The business
was in pretty good shape now, and the girls would love it. Yes, they
would go abroad. He would broach the subject that very day and hurry
up arrangements to get away as soon as possible. He couldn't stand any
more shocks like this one!

Thus reasoning, he grew calm, and the family went down to the new car
and their interrupted holiday.


Down on the street Mrs. Sheldon looked about her in a dazed way and put
her hand to her head. Her companion caught the gesture and slipped an
arm around her.

"My dear, you are going straight back to the hotel and take a good long
sleep," she said, and raised her other hand to summon a passing taxi.

"Oh, I'm all right," murmured the little white-faced mother,
"Everything is all right now at least I hope it is, for a while.
Only—what shall I do with Daisy? Her life is broken! My poor little
flower of a girl!"

"Don't you believe it!" said the strong woman who knew life. "God
doesn't let even a flower get broken as easily as that. Here, let's get
in this taxi, and then we can talk."

She gave the order to the driver, and then laid her hand on the
stricken woman's arm.

"My dear! You should be singing, shouting hallelujah, not mourning.
Can't you trust the Father who has brought about this revelation to
show your girl that life isn't all gone just because she made a mistake
about one wolf in sheep's clothing? This all came to your girl perhaps
to teach her, and prepare her for a fuller, wider life than she could
have otherwise been prepared for."

"Oh!" moaned the little mother, "I wish I could feel that way, but it
seems to me we have lost our self-respect. It seems as if Daisy has
lost all the fine dignity and judgment she had, and that she can never
lift up her head again."

"She has only lost her cock-suredness, my dear. She hasn't lost a bit
of self-respect. She has made a mistake, yes, and a bad one, but she
will learn to be more careful now, not to trust herself implicitly. She
will learn to pray her way through the difficulties, perhaps, instead
of insisting she knows best and demanding her own way. She will pay
more heed to her mother's advice to her mother's intuition, and not
consider that her own discernment of character is final. You know we
all have to have sharp lessons to teach us to find our guidance in the
Lord and our own utter helplessness without Him."

"But I'm so afraid Daisy won't look at it that way. She is such an
intense child, so proud and excitable, and enthusiastic, and so prone
to go to the depths when the heights have failed her. I am afraid—Mrs.
Dunlap, forgive me, but I'm afraid she may lose her mind! You were not
with her that last night before she went away. You don't realize."

"I realize that underneath are the Everlasting Arms, my dear," said
Mary Dunlap solemnly, "and that the God who has just now performed
the seemingly impossible for you in convincing your daughter of the
unworthiness of the man whom she was determined to marry, in time and
before it was forever too late to save her from the public shame of her
own actions, can perform like wonders in other ways. Now, dear sister,
suppose you just trust in Him. He has said, 'Commit thy way unto the
Lord; trust also in Him and He shall bring it to pass.' Couldn't you
just rest on that this morning and let Him give you a good rest? I'm
sure everything will be made plain for you. Now, here we are at the
hotel."

Mary Dunlap helped her friend up to her room for she looked as frail as
a lily by this time; and had a nice little lunch sent up of which she
literally forced her companion to partake.

When she found the troubled mother did not wish to talk of other
matters she just went over the morning's experience with her, bringing
out at every turn, the wonders that the Lord had worked. She spoke of
the young man, Whitney.

"Tell me about him!" she said as she poured a second cup of coffee.
"I'm wonderfully taken with that young man. He looks like true blue to
me."

"Oh, he is!" said Marguerite's mother.

And she began to tell of the days the years when her girl and this fine
boy were growing up together, till gradually the care lifted from the
mother's face.

But the tale came to a sudden bitter end with the plaint that was
almost a sob:

"She had all that devotion in a fine young man her own age, and yet she
could think she cared for that old slippery beast!"

Mary Dunlap gave an almost girlish giggle.

"He is that, isn't he? I keep thinking of his poor dear wife and
daughters who think he is the salt of the earth. Oh, poor dears! I do
hope they don't ever have to find it out this side—or at least not till
the Lord has made him over. But my dear, don't you think that perhaps
your child hadn't just waked up to realities yet? Wasn't she more in
love with being in love, than with the man himself? She was under a
strong delusion as the Bible says, but I'm sure it has been swept away,
and in full time.

"My dear, I'll tell you something. Her hand was on the boy's arm
confidingly as if she trusted him, and his strong hand was over it,
tenderly, comfortingly, as if she were dearer to him than life. I
couldn't help seeing the look on his face as he bent to speak to her
from his fine height—she is such a little girl, so sweet and small—and
my dear, I suppose I ought not to have seen it, and maybe ought to
keep it to myself now I have, but it seems to me you have a right to
know she smiled up into his face, such a sweet trustful smile, that I
couldn't help feeling that her heart will fly back to him as a refuge
now in her trouble. I saw that. Yes, I saw it while you were talking to
Mrs. Oliver. I'm sure you have a right to know. And the Lord has let
that young man be an instrument of rescue for your girl. I'm sure."

"Oh!" said the mother with a wistful sigh, "If that could only be, I
would ask nothing better of life."

"Don't set your limits, my dear! The Lord may have that and even
greater blessings yet in store. Now, you are going to sleep, and I'm
going to sit here at the desk and get some of my correspondence out of
the way or I'll be swamped."



CHAPTER XIII

DOWN in the street Marguerite almost gave way.

A glance at her face showed Nelson that she was almost at the limit of
her strength. He summoned a taxi and put her in.

"Would you like to go to the hotel and lie down a while?" he asked
tenderly.

"Oh, no," she said shrinking toward him, "I don't want to be alone now.
I can't bear it. I must have someone who belongs. Let's go to some
quiet place where we can sit down a little while, or walk where there
won't be so many people."

She sank back in the seat and closed her eyes, and Whitney gave the
order, "Drive to the Park, and drive around till I tell you to stop."

He got into the taxi, pulled down the shades, and drew her head gently
over till it rested on his shoulder.

"Now," said he, "just rest there a few minutes and get calm."

There were hot tears running down her white cheeks.

"That's all right, dear," he said as if he were talking to a little
child. "Cry as hard as you can. It'll do you good!"

There was a lilt in his voice. He was thinking how she had said she
wanted to be with somebody who "belonged." Then in her soul she felt
that he belonged after all.

Marguerite let the tears have their way for a minute or two, and then
she sobbed out softly:

"But you don't know what it's all about. I—ought—to—explain."

"Explain, nothing!" said Nelson comfortingly. "I know all about it."

"Oh! How did you know?" she asked with a perplexed frown, "Did mother
tell you?"

"Never a word," said the young man taking out a big white handkerchief
that smelled of clover in summer, and unfolding it. "Can't you give me
credit for having eyes? When you love somebody, you understand."

He lifted the girl's hot tear-wet face and gently wiped it with the
cool handkerchief.

She felt as if she were a little girl being comforted.

"Oh, Nelson, you've always been wonderful! And—I—But you won't
feel that way about me any more when you know everything. I've
been—so—silly—! And wicked, Nelson! I've been terribly wicked. Oh—" she
shuddered,—"to think that I—should have got into an awful mess like
that! Oh, I can't ever stand myself again! How can I live? To think—"

"See here, Marguerite, you're not to think anything about it now. You
are just to rest, and get over the shock. And by and bye when you are
rested, we'll talk it all out."

"But I want to get it over with first," said Marguerite sitting up and
trying to stop the tears with the big handkerchief. "Indeed I can't
rest till you know what a fool I've been."

"All right," said Nelson, "you've been a fool, have you? Well, I love
you anyway. Have you had any breakfast? No, I thought not. Well,
neither have I. What if we stop somewhere and get some?"

"But I can't go anywhere with my eyes all red," objected the girl,
dabbing away at them and looking as pretty as a picture even with a red
nose, and her lashes all wet.

"That's all right," said the young man easily, "we're going to get out
pretty soon and walk around the park a little. I think we'll find a
fountain or a spring or a lake or something wet, and we'll mop up and
get cooled off and then we'll go and get fed."

Marguerite giggled hysterically.

"You are always so good," she murmured, and then refinished it,
"so—dear!"

He stooped over and kissed her gravely on the forehead.

"Thank you for that, little one. Now, are you ready to get out and find
that fountain?"

"Wait," said the girl sitting up, her face clouded with trouble again.
"Wait, Nelson, we can't go on like this. We can't even be friends again
till I tell you everything. It—chokes me!"

"Out with it, then!" said the young man calmly, "but make it snappy.
Make a clean breast of it in three sentences."

"Oh, Nelson, I fell in love with that man—a married man!" She lifted
her shamed face and looked at him through her tears.

"That's number one," said Nelson, unperturbed.

"I started to run away with him and get married, without telling
Mother," she burst forth with a fresh rush of tears.

"Number two," counted Nelson.

"And—and—I've been awful to Mother, and to that Mrs. Dunlap—" she
choked out, "and—and—to God! I almost lost my senses!"

"I inferred as much. Now, is that all, little sweetheart? And shall we
get out and doll up for breakfast?"

She buried her face in the folds of the wet handkerchief once more, and
from its depths murmured: "Oh, Nelson, you always did take the ache out
of things!"

"That's what I'm for," grinned Nelson delightedly, "and I always intend
to keep on doing it. You know you're mine, little girl, have been ever
since we were children, and I don't intend anything to hurt you any
more than I can possibly help. Of course, if you get sick—" he smiled,
"mentally sick, or physically sick, or spiritually sick, I'll just have
to stand by and help till you get well again, but you're mine, little
girl. I want that distinctly understood. Now, shall we get out and walk
a little?"

"But Nelson—you mustn't. I'm not worthy of a devotion like that—I
couldn't let you—"

"We're getting out, driver," Nelson tapped on the glass.

He helped her out and paid the fare, and while Marguerite stood still
in the bright sunshine at the entrance to a Park pathway, the cool
breeze blowing on her hot cheeks and forehead, her face a little turned
away lest the cabman should see that she had been crying, suddenly a
great burden seemed to roll from her.

She had expected to find herself desperate, agonized, unable to live
longer, when she got away from that terrible office where she had
undergone such awful revelations; but suddenly it seemed to her a
great relief. The fearful responsibilities of life that a day ago had
lain upon her heart with deathlike heaviness, were gone. Life had been
settled for her, and her path diverted from a dark and perilous way,
into brightness and sunshine again.

The only thing that hung about and troubled her was her own shame. Her
part in the terrible drama that had just been played to the finish. Her
foolishness and gullibility, her readiness to fall for the handsome
eyes of a man of the world, whose flattery had been merely used for his
own passing amusement. She, Marguerite Sheldon, with a long line of
respectable and noble ancestors, with a heritage of Christian training
and tradition, with a mother such as hers had been, and a father whose
memory was enshrined forever in her heart! To think that she had been
so easy to deceive!

She started suddenly at the thought of how her heart was arraigning the
man who had been her lover—almost her husband, but a few brief days
ago! Three hours ago she would have sworn to anyone who asked that she
loved him with her whole soul; that life would be worthless without
him; that she would cling to him with her last breath though she were
separated from him for years; that she would love him and believe him,
yes and even forgive him no matter what others said, no matter what he
had done.

And now in a few short minutes, the cloak of illusion had been torn
from him, and left his shame naked to her view; left him without a
charm or virtue; shown his love to be a mere worthless pretense, for
how could he possibly love her when he had so deceived her? How could
he dare bring her a love so dishonored by his own broken, worse than
broken vows? For she was not one of those girls who feel it a fine
feather to have won for herself a man who belongs to another.

She shivered as she remembered the way he had said: "My wife," and, "my
daughters," in that accustomed married way. If she had heard nothing
else but that it would have convinced her. And sharply to her memory
came her own words to Mrs. Dunlap, "Unless I can hear him say with his
own lips—"

Well, she had heard him! How terrible it had been! Hot irons had seared
her heart, and she would never, never forget!

As she turned toward Nelson, she glanced down, and there in the path
behind him she caught the gleam of a bit of metal, gold or silver
shining in the sun. It proved to be only a bit of foil wrapping from
candy or gum that someone had flung down carelessly in passing. But
with the unexplained whimsicality of such little inanimate things, it
took for the moment the form of a tiny trinket in likeness to a gold
and platinum charm that the one-time Rufus Keller had worn on his watch
chain. During those intimate days she had more than once toyed with it
lovingly, pleased to think such was her privilege. She had even worn it
about her neck on a little gold chain for a few days, till alarmed lest
her mother should see it, she had given it back for the time.

Suddenly it came to her that he had worn it that very morning. She had
noticed its gleam as he turned away with that guilty look, that look
that she never would forget. The look that had torn from her heart the
last shred of respect, and what she had once thought was love for this
man. And the little gleaming trinket had twinkled wickedly at her as he
went, and stabbed her with the things that she once had held so dear.
Stabbed her as when a thorn that has bruised the bleeding flesh is torn
away and can hurt no more.

She caught her breath in a sob as Nelson came up with her and slipped
his hand within her arm steadying her.

"Oh, how can I ever live? How can I ever, ever stand it?" she gasped.

"Poor child!" said Nelson sadly, "Do you love him as much as that?"

"Oh, no! No! Not now!" she cried. "That is all gone! But my
self-respect is gone too! How can one live without self-respect?"

"That will come back again!" said Nelson Whitney with a ring in his
voice. Oh, it was good to hear her say she no longer cared!

She was quiet for several minutes, and he watched her as they
walked along deeper into the park. Then she lifted her face like a
rain-drenched flower.

"Nelson, you are wonderful!" she said. "I don't—know—what I should
do—without you!"

"Well, you don't have to do without me, thank God!" said Nelson. "I
suppose this is why He sent me down here."

She looked up with quick inquiry.

"How did you come, Nelson? Was it just chance?"

"Nothing in this world is chance, is it, Daisy? But this certainly
wasn't, anyway. Why, you see I went to the house to get that list you
promised—"

"Oh!" said the girl. "I never thought of it again."

"Well, it's of no consequence now," he grinned, "I made up one instead
and ordered the things. You'll have to use what there is, or get more.
However, when Mary and I started to look for the list there was your
note to your mother right on the floor by the stairs in the lower hall.
How it got there I don't know, but as Mary was upstairs and I hadn't
much time, and the note was in your handwriting, I picked it up and
read it. Of course I hadn't gone far before I discovered it wasn't the
list, but I couldn't let it go then for I had caught a word or two that
showed me you were in danger, and that your mother must be somewhere
in sorrow hunting for you, so I put it in my pocket as Mary came down
stairs and took it away with me. If you ask me I think the Lord left
that note there for me to read. I thought you belonged enough to me to
give me the right to read it."

Marguerite with reddening cheeks and shamed eyes was trying to recall
what she had said in that mad hasty note she had left for her mother
when she hurried to the midnight train.

"The rest was a cinch of course," went on Nelson. "I had the address to
which you were going in your own handwriting. I had only to meet you at
the train in New York as it came in, if I could get there ahead of you.
Or, failing in that, as I did, I had the second chance of catching you
at the office before you went off to marry that villain."

Marguerite's shamed face did not lift, but a little quiver went through
her slight frame.

"But—how did you get here in time?" she asked. "Why, that must have
been rather late in the morning when you found that note. Of course I
knew there was an early morning train and that Mother would probably
take that, but I had hoped to have everything straightened out before
she came. But the only other train after you found out is a local, and
you couldn't possibly have got here even yet unless you flew. Are you a
mystery man?"

"That's exactly what I did. I flew here," said Nelson.

"What do you mean?" she asked lifting wondering eyes that seemed to
have forgotten their trouble for the moment. "Don't tease me, please.
I'm so tired!" And she drooped upon his arm.

"Poor little girl! I'm forgetting all you've gone through. We'll find
that water, and then go for something to eat. If I remember, it was
down this path. I came here once three years ago, and thought how some
day I would perhaps bring you."

A quick turn brought them to a spring gurgling in a granite basin, and
Marguerite dashed the water in her face and dried it on another big
clean handkerchief that Nelson brought forth from a capacious pocket.

"Do you have an unlimited supply of these?" she asked as she emerged
from its fragrant folds gratefully, refreshed in spite of herself.

"Very nearly!" he smiled. "Now come, and we will go and find something
to eat."

"But you haven't told me what you mean by saying you flew here." He
noticed that her voice was almost cheerful again.

"Just that," he said laughing, "I flew. It's the first time in my life,
but I would have enjoyed it if I hadn't been so worried about you."

Then as her eyes looked still mystified, he explained.

"I have a friend who has been coaxing me to fly with him for months
and I never seemed to have time. He had oodles of money, and no end
of time, and so I just made good a promise I had given him once, and
called him up. He was game all right, said of course he was going to
New York in a couple of hours, and so we came. We got here sometime
before your train came in. By the way, why didn't you come on it?"

"I did," she said sadly, "but I got off at the wrong station, something
they called Manhattan Transfer. I had to wait ages before another came
along."

"Manhattan Transfer! And you were knocking around that desolate place
alone at that time of night? Well, I'll say your angels must have had
their hands full taking care of you yesterday. They must be all worn
out. I guess that's why I have the job for a little while now. Come,
here's a taxi!"

She flashed him a faint little flicker of a smile and he helped her
into the cab with a lighter heart. At least the days of reticence and
distance were over between them. No more reservations, no more holding
aloof. She was confiding in him as she used to do. One couldn't expect
more than that, so soon.

They went to a quiet tea room. Nelson seemed to know just how to manage
everything, seemed to know without asking his way anywhere. He put her
in a seat where she was sheltered, and he ordered the things he knew
from long years of association that she liked. Deftly, unobtrusively,
he drew her attention away from herself, and the tragic happenings
of the last few days, tempted her to eat, provoked her to laugh. He
described his first sensations of flying, telling little anecdotes
of his friend the aviator when they were both together in France,
telling a joke he had heard the day before, calling her attention to
a beautiful white kitten that came purring in to be stroked and fed
tidbits.

It was nearly three o'clock when they had finished the meal. The color
was stealing faintly back to the girl's lips and cheeks, and the terror
fading out of her eyes.

"Now," said Nelson consulting his watch, "it's three minutes to three.
What do you want to do? Shall we make good our word and go to the Tomb
and the Museum, or shall we save that for another day and go back to
the hotel and let you get a good rest?"

"Oh," said Marguerite, shrinking suddenly, the color receding from her
lips, the terror coming back to her eyes. "Oh, I can't go back—yet!
But don't let me detain you—I'll—I'll just wander around a little—I'll
go—shopping!" she ended with an attempt at briskness in her voice.
"You've been awfully good."

"Now, look here, Marguerite, haven't I known you too long and loved
you too well, for you to get off any bunk like that on me?" he asked
laughing. "I'm here to take care of you, and what you want to do is
what I want to do. What I meant is, are you too tired to take on sight
seeing or are you really interested? It occurred to me that we weren't
either of us in a state to get much intellectual good out of either a
tomb or a museum, but perhaps I'm mistaken. If you want to, we'll go.
But if you are not particular which day we go tombing, suppose we take
a lighter expedition. I'll tell you what would just suit me. I'd like
to take you down to Tiffany's and buy you the prettiest diamond ring we
can find."

Marguerite started back in her chair.

"Oh, Nelson! What do you mean?"

Her face was a curious study of tenderness and fear.

"I mean just that, Daisy. I think it's high time you had some kind of a
safeguard to wear. I've loved you too long and known you too well, to
let you drift around the world unprotected any longer."

"But—Nelson—"

"Yes, I know—you want to tell me that you don't love me—that you
couldn't possibly love one man when you've just got over caring for
another, and all that—but I'm going to do this anyway. The chances are
that you may some day find out you do care a little and then everything
will be all right. But if you don't, why, there are such things as
broken engagements.

"You don't have to marry me if you find out I'm a villain, or that you
love somebody else better. But you do have to wear my ring for a while
anyway. You're not going back home without it, I'll tell the world.
Nobody is going to have a chance, not that dirty crook of a Keller
anyway, to say that he threw you over. You're going home engaged to me,
Marguerite Sheldon, whatever you do with me afterward, you may as well
understand that I have the upper hand now, and you're going to have a
ring, right now!

"You can take it for all the love I have in the world, if you're
willing, or you can take it for just a means of protection for the time
being if that suits you any better, but somehow I'm going to put my tag
on my property. Until you've told me that you out and out can't love me
ever, I'm out to see that you're known as belonging to me."

There was such quiet strength and tenderness in the way he said these
words, so low that they could not possibly reach other ears than her
own, so full of real feeling and earnestness, that she could not turn
away from, nor laugh it off. It choked her to think how great and
tender he was to her.

"Nelson, you're sorry for me and you're dear, but you don't need to go
to such lengths," she began helplessly.

"Marguerite," he rebuked her, "that's beneath you. You know I never
lie! You know I would not say it if it were not the dearest wish of my
heart. You know I've loved you ever since I can remember."

She was still a long time, the sweet color coming into her cheeks;
lifting she eyes at last she said:

"Nelson, forgive me I shouldn't have said that. I know what you've
always been. But I didn't know till to-day quite how wonderful you
were. I believe you, and I think it's the greatest thing in the world
you have done for me. Your love is the greatest thing the world can
ever give me, and I'm sure I don't know what I would ever be without
you. I would tell you that I love you too, only I've been so many kinds
of a fool the last year and a half that I don't even trust myself to
say it. It seems cowardly of me to creep into the refuge you offer me,
when I have so little to give. A threadbare love that was thrown away
on an old married man with grown daughters!"

His face grew strangely tender.

"That's all right, little girl, I understand what you've been through.
It's no wonder you distrust yourself, but I trust you, when you get rid
of the mists and get back to yourself. We'll strike square with each
other and you can trust me. I won't ask you to marry me till you're
ready, and not then if you don't love me enough to be happy with me,
better than any other man on earth—but I do ask you to wear my ring
home and let it be a shelter to you, in any complex circumstances that
this situation may happen to bring about."

She was still a long time, drawing little patterns with the tip of
her spoon on the table cloth. At last she lifted hesitating eyes half
shamed.

"Nelson—have you thought what Mother will think if I do this? Off with
the old love and on with the new? Won't Mother be more horrified than
ever at me? Won't she think I'm utterly false at heart?"

"Your mother will simply jump for joy," said Nelson Whitney solemnly.
"Take it from me. It would be the happiest moment of her life if she
could see my ring on your hand and know you wanted it there."

"So soon—after—"

"The sooner the quicker!" said Nelson, wrinkling his face into his
nicest smile. "Come! Let's go!"

She followed him in a tumult of joy and doubt. Could it be right for
her to be happy like this, when only a few hours ago she had been—

But Nelson was summoning another taxi, and in a few whirls they were
entering the great Fifth Avenue store.

When she came out again a little while later, after going the beautiful
rounds among priceless jewels and fragile glass that looked like the
breath of a frozen flower, she was wearing his ring on her hand, and a
soft depth of joy in her eyes that was good to see.

"And now," said Nelson, as he summoned another taxi, "I think we had
better go and find Mother, and tell her all about it, don't you? It
seems to me she has suffered about long enough."



CHAPTER XIV

IT WAS late that evening before mother and daughter were alone at last.

Mrs. Dunlap had responded to a telegram and left on the seven o'clock
train for Boston to meet in conference with an important committee on
some international work for young women.

Nelson Whitney had attended to all her wants as the son of the family
might have waited on a powerful ally who had pulled them all out of
distress.

He took Mrs. Sheldon and her daughter to a wonderful symphony orchestra
concert with a soloist of world reputation, and then brought them back
to the hotel refusing to remain for even a few minutes because they
needed to rest. He attended them up to the door of their room, kissed
Marguerite reverently, and then half shyly kissed her mother and said:
"Good night, Mother!" with an accent in his tone that spoke volumes.

He left both mother and daughter tingling with joy and pride in him,
and then at last the door was closed on the outer world, shutting them
in alone together.

The girl hurried into the closet to hang up her coat and hat, feeling a
sudden shyness before her mother, realizing all at once that there were
some things that must be made clear between them before she could feel
that all was right.

The mother removed her street things slowly, a light of almost
other-worldly joy in her face. She was thinking of what her new friend
had said to her that afternoon, and of the Bible verse she had quoted
to her. And how wonderfully, and swiftly the promise had been made good
to her. Why, she had scarcely waked from that refreshing sleep into
which she had fallen pillowed on that promise, when the fulfillment had
knocked at her door in the person of Nelson and Marguerite come to show
her the ring.

Marguerite had been shy and lovely, but almost silent and they had not
pressed her to talk much. She had been most humble and loving toward
her mother and Mrs. Dunlap, thanking that great-hearted woman in no
uncertain words, although they were few, and clasping her in a close
penitent embrace when she left.

But to her mother Marguerite had as yet said not one word about the
happenings of the last few days. She had let her lover do all the
talking, and had sat with downcast lashes, and a childlike contentment
in her face that yet spoke volumes of reassurance to the two who had
waited through the long hours to know how it fared with her.

But now the time had come, and Marguerite knew it, to have it out with
her mother.

She stayed in the closet several minutes arranging her things, being
most careful about how her hat was placed on the shelf, and searching
in her coat pocket for a handkerchief she was not sure was there. But
at last she came out.

Mrs. Sheldon was taking down her hair for the night, and it fell in
lovely silver waves to her waist, with soft little tendrils, and a curl
or two at the ends. It seemed to glorify her delicate face and set her
off as if it had been a halo.

The girl watched her lovely mother for a moment, wistfully, wishing she
would begin, and then suddenly she burst forth with tears:

"I don't see how I could have done it to you!" she said in a cry of
sorrow. "You are so dear and lovely, and here I've led you through all
this horrible mess! I don't see how you can ever love me again!"

With one swift movement, as if she had been young again, the mother
turned and folded her child in her arms.

"My darling!" she said. "Oh, my darling!" And held her so close she
could hardly breathe.

It was a long time they stood so, Marguerite's face hidden in her
mother's neck, the mother's lips against her child's hot forehead,
touching her hair with caresses that could not be measured nor counted
nor described because it would be a desecration.

No words passed between them, nor was there any need. It was as if
their thoughts were as open to one another as if they had been one, so
close their hearts seemed to come.

At last the girl lifted her hot, shamed, forgiven face to her mother.
There was one more thing that had to be spoken:

"Mother, you must think I'm an awful fool. You must think awful things
of me that I let Nelson—that he—that I—so soon after—" She hid her
shamed face once more on her mother's shoulder, and the mother arms
clasped her close again.

"No, dear, I don't think awful things. I think my girl has been through
a bewildering experience and didn't know her own mind, was not capable
of judging, but I think you have come back to your senses again, and
I thank God that you have such a wonderful friend as Nelson who has
been willing after all the suffering you have given him through these
months, to put the protection of his love about you. He could not be a
greater comfort to me, and to you if he were my own son."

The girl was still a long time, and then she said timidly:

"Yes, Mother, he is wonderful! More wonderful even than I have told you
yet or you have seen. But Mother, you think I let him get that ring
just to protect me from gossips, just to let others see that I had not
been a fool! But I didn't, Mother. I truly didn't! I couldn't have done
that not even to protect you from all the shame and disgrace of having
people find out just what really did happen. I couldn't have unless I
had loved him. You think perhaps it couldn't be true love so soon after
I thought I was dying for that other man, but it is, it is. It seems as
if I had never really known love before.

"Why, Mother, when Nelson began to tell me how he felt toward me, and
what I was to him, it opened a whole new world to me. I hadn't known
what love was before. I hadn't dreamed what it could be. It seemed as
if the other had just been a cheap imitation of it. It showed up the
other experience. I began to see in contrast how selfish Rufus—I mean
Mr. Oliver—had been, how all he talked about was a good time, something
to amuse—how he did not seem to care about whether I was pleased or
not, only to bend me to his will. It hadn't seemed that way at all
before. But Mother, I've been thinking about it all the evening, trying
to see how I could make you understand, and I believe I was just proud
to think a man as wise and experienced as I thought he was, had stooped
to notice me, and I was frantic when I thought I had lost him.

"But Mother, I didn't know the deep sweet joy I feel now in Nelson. I
didn't know there was such joy. Truly, Mother and you know it isn't
as if I had just met Nelson—he's been dear always—always—since I was
just a little girl, only he never opened this door to his soul before
and let me see how he had put me in his heart on a throne. And it has
just carried me into heaven, Mother, but I know you think I haven't any
right—not a bit of right to it—since—since—"

"Yes, you have, my dear. I do think you have. I have watched your
face. You are a different girl. You have met the real thing at last
and recognized it. I couldn't have hoped it would come to you so soon.
I was fearful what might happen to you in the interval, till our new
friend showed me that I might trust you with my heavenly Father. And
somehow, my precious child, I believe He let this come to you so soon
just to show us both how He can heal, and how He will lead and save and
bless those who trust Him entirely with their lives."

Said the girl, laying her hot cheek against her mother's soft one:

"Oh, Mother! You are the most wonderful woman in the world! And Mrs.
Dunlap is next. What should we have done without her? Suppose I had
gone on and had my own way! Suppose—suppose—I had lost Nelson! Just
think! Even if the other man hadn't been what he was—suppose I had
missed knowing Nelson's love! Oh, Mother! You don't know how wonderful
Nelson is! I can never make you understand. He is—different! He
is—wonderful!"

"I believe it!" said the mother fervently. "And now let us kneel down
and thank God for the wonderful way in which he has led us."

A little later, while her mother was preparing for the night,
Marguerite took out her little Bible that always traveled with her when
she went anywhere because it was a part of the fittings of the bag
which her mother had given her the Christmas before. Opening it, she
paused with startled eyes. At last she said:

"Mother, listen to this. I opened right to it, Isaiah 42.16, 'I will
bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths
that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them,

PREFACE


It has long seemed to me both unfortunate and wrong that many pupils
leave school with no keen delight in the study of English grammar,
and with the mistaken idea that it is mainly a study of rules and
definitions based upon the forms of mere words. Far from this, it
should be from the beginning a study of thought. Words should be
examined solely from the point of view of their function in the
sentence, the part they play in the communication of thought. Always
the sentence should be the unit of study, and it should be looked
at, not primarily as expressing a thought that was once in the mind
of its author, but rather as forever communicating thought to the
minds of its readers. For men would neither speak nor write without
an audience. Their aim is not to get their thought into words for
satisfaction to themselves, but to convey thought by means of words to
their fellow-men. Therefore it is that in all language study, in all
language teaching, the governing idea should be, not expression, but
communication, of thought.

It is now universally conceded that the purposes of grammar study
are three; namely, and in the order of their importance and
their realization,--1. to discipline the mind; 2. to aid in the
interpretation of speech and literature; 3. to facilitate the correct
expression of thought. It cannot, then, be denied that a rational
investigation of the structure of English sentences is far more
important than any other phase of grammar study, and for three
reasons:--1. it is a study of thought, and as such must discipline the
mind; 2. it trains the student through practice, which is the most
effective way, to interpret the thought of others; 3. by presenting to
him the best models for imitation, it aids him in communicating clearly
his own thoughts.

Believing this, and knowing from much experience that not until
students have examined the structure of sentences in relation to
the thought embodied, do they have any vital or useful knowledge of
etymology and syntax, I have long thought that a book was needed which
should deal only with the analysis of sentences, the culminating phase
of grammar study, for which all previous work is a preparation. The
book that I have prepared is not intended to supplant any text-book in
grammar, but rather to provide for a profitable continuation of grammar
study in high schools and normal schools. It is based upon the English
sentence as it has been written during the present century. No attempt
has been made to criticize any form or variation of sentence structure.
Instead, sentences are examined as they have been constructed by
reputable authors, with a view to determining the adequacy of their
structure to the communication of thought.

My highest aim and my sincerest hope have been to present worthy
matter in such a way as to require and stimulate good thinking on the
part of students, and to make them marvel and rejoice at the perfect
adaptability of the English sentence to the noble burden that it bears,
that of communicating thought.

THE

STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH SENTENCE

CHAPTER I

THE PROPOSITION


In the mind of every human being there are innumerable ideas, or mental
pictures, gathered from previous experience. Whenever we perceive a
relation between any two of these ideas, we form a judgment, or, in
other words, have a thought. If we wish to communicate our thought we
ordinarily express it in words, and this verbal expression of a thought
we call a sentence.

For example, I have an idea of _children_ and an idea of the activity
called _play_; I see a relation between them, that of agent and thing
done; I affirm this relation, and have the sentence, _Children play_.
Or I detect a relation between _flower_ and _whiteness_, and say, _The
flower is white_. Or I fail to establish such a relation and so deny
the former statement by saying, _The flower is not white_. In each case
my sentence serves the great purpose of communicating thought; and it
does this by calling up in the mind of the reader the same combination
of ideas that exists in my mind.

Another name for sentences like those just formed, is _proposition_,
a proposition being the expression of one thought. But since a
proposition is the statement of a judgment, it must contain two ideas.
One of these, denoting that of which something is asserted, we call
the _subject_; the other, denoting what is said of the subject, we call
the _predicate_. The relation between these two ideas cannot always
be expressed by means of two words. If we wish to assert a relation
between _water_ and _freshness_, we must use at least three words,
_Water is fresh_; the word _is_ contains little, if any, meaning, but
is necessary for the grammatical expression of the thought.

Although a proposition must contain at least two ideas, it may contain
any number of them. For example, I may expand the proposition,
_Children play_, by additional ideas, telling (1) whose children, (2)
a characteristic of the children, (3) what they play, (4) where they
play, (5) when they play,--_My neighbor’s little children play hide and
seek in their yard every evening_. Still I have only one proposition,
for the number of propositions in a sentence depends on the number of
judgments, or thoughts, expressed,--in other words, on the number of
assertions made; and here there is but one, that made essentially by
the verb _play_.

All sentences, however, are not single propositions, for in building
sentences we often go a step further than seeing the relation between
ideas, that is, we see the relation between thoughts; and so, instead
of combining mere words, we combine whole propositions into one
sentence. Take, for example, the two propositions, _Children play_, and
_Children enjoy play_. I may see that the second fact is a cause of the
first, and, by combining the two so as to bring out this relation of
cause and effect, get the sentence, _Children play because they enjoy
it_, wherein I substitute the pronouns they and it for the already
known words _children_ and _play_.

Or take the two propositions, _The lion roared_, and _The hyena
laughed_. I may wish to tell some one that these two actions were
related in time, occurring simultaneously; I do this by saying, _The
lion roared and the hyena laughed_, where I have one sentence, but
made of two propositions, because conveying two thoughts. I might put
in other thoughts, telling (1) which lion, (2) why he roared, (3) how
long the hyena laughed,--The lion _that was kept in the cage near the
door_ roared _because the keeper did not bring his food_, and the hyena
laughed _till he had set all the animals around him in an uproar_. Here
I have one sentence containing five thoughts, therefore made up of five
propositions.

However, it is not with composition, the building up of sentences, that
we are to concern ourselves, so much as with an examination into the
structure of the finished product. Now, when we study the structure of
the human body, we look upon it first as a symmetrical whole, then we
separate it into its largest, most distinct members,--the head, the
trunk, the arms, the legs. After we have noted the relations of these
parts, we take up each part as a whole and proceed again in the same
way. In analyzing sentences we shall pursue the same method.

Every sentence is a unit just as the body is; like the body, too,
it is made up of smaller units. In studying its structure we should
first of all find the units which compose the sentence-unit. If the
sentence is a single proposition, the constituent units are, of course,
the subject and the predicate. But if the sentence is a combination
of propositions, as is oftener the case, then its chief units are
these propositions. Therefore, as a foundation for the analysis of
sentences, we must be able to determine readily how many propositions a
given sentence contains. Our first exercise will be devoted to this end.


Exercise 1

Resolve the following sentences into single propositions. Remember that
the number of propositions depends on the number of assertions made.

 1. There are thousands of years between the stone hatchet and the
 machine shop.--_C. W. Eliot._

 2. All along the Atlantic, the country is bordered by a broad tract,
 called the _tierra caliente_, or hot region, which has the usual high
 temperature of equinoctial lands.--_Prescott._

 3. Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of
 matrimony rolled on; a tart temper never mellows with age, and a
 sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant
 use.--_Irving._

 4. Every thing around me wore that happy look which makes the heart
 glad.--_Longfellow._

 5. I came from India as a child, and our ship touched at an island
 on the way home, where my black servant took me a long walk over
 rocks and hills, until we reached a garden where we saw a man
 walking.--_Thackeray._

 6. As a painter may draw a cloud so that we recognize its general
 truth, though the boundaries of real clouds never remain the same for
 two minutes together, so, amid the changes of feature and complexion,
 brought about by commingling of race, there still remains a certain
 cast of physiognomy, which points back to some one ancestor of marked
 and peculiar character.--_Lowell._

 7. Our eyes are holden that we cannot see things that stare us in the
 face, until the hour arrives when the mind is ripened.--_Emerson._

 8. The burning sun of Syria had not yet attained its highest point in
 the horizon, when a knight of the Red Cross, who had left his distant
 northern home and joined the host of the Crusaders in Palestine, was
 pacing slowly along the sandy deserts which lie in the vicinity of the
 Dead Sea, where the waves of the Jordan pour themselves into an inland
 sea from which there is no discharge of waters.--_Scott._

 9.  Through the black Tartar tents he passed which stood,
     Clustering like bee hives on the low, flat strand
     Of Oxus, where the summer floods o’erflow
     When the sun melts the snow in high Pamere.

  --_M. Arnold._

 10. On a fine, breezy forenoon I am audaciously skeptical, but, as
 twilight sets in, my credulity grows steadily, till it becomes equal
 to anything that could be desired.--_De Quincey._

 11. Although it was now well on towards dark and the sun was down an
 hour or so, I could see the robbers’ road before me in a trough of the
 winding hills, where the brook plowed down from the higher barrows,
 and the coving banks were roofed with furze.--_Blackmore._

 12. In one place the poet describes a congregation gathered to listen
 to a preacher in a great unillumined cathedral at night.--_Wm. James._




CHAPTER II

THE CLASSIFICATION OF PROPOSITIONS


=How Propositions differ in Nature.=--In studying the human body we
cannot help seeing that all the prominent members are not equally
important. Some could exist independently of others, while some
are joined directly to a more important part, and, if separated
from it, would have no use or life. So, in studying a sentence, we
notice that all the propositions are not equal in rank. Some are
complete sentences in themselves; others would not make sense if
they were obliged to stand alone. Hence there arise two classes of
propositions,--_principal_ and _subordinate_, or _independent_ and
_dependent._

In every sentence there is at least one primary thought which it is the
author’s main purpose to communicate, and this will always be found
in the principal proposition. There may be modifying circumstances of
time, place, manner, condition, etc., which he wishes to embody in
his sentence, but he brings these in by means of words and phrases,
which are elements of the principal proposition, or else, if the
language affords no adequate words and phrases, by means of subordinate
propositions.

In the following sentence from Carlyle,--“How true is that old fable
of the Sphinx, who sat by the wayside propounding her riddle to the
passengers,” there are plainly two propositions. It is also plain that
the thought which the author wished most to convey is this,--The old
fable of the Sphinx is true. In fact, it was the prime importance of
this thought that led him to put it in the principal proposition. He
chose to add the thought expressed in the second proposition, but he
showed its minor importance by constructing the proposition so that
it serves as a mere modifier of the word _Sphinx_. From a grammatical
point of view the first proposition is complete,--it could stand alone
and make sense; hence it is called _independent_. On the other hand,
the second proposition, if separated from the first, would lose its
meaning; it is therefore said to be dependent.

Consider these sentences:

 1. The Mohawk hardly feels the scalping-knife while he shouts his
 death song.--_Macaulay._

 2. No success is worthy of the name unless it is won by honest
 industry and a brave breasting of the waves of fortune.--_Huxley._

 3. That country is the fairest which is inhabited by the noblest
 minds.--_Emerson._

If we separate each of these sentences into its two propositions
and apply the test,--_which proposition is by itself grammatically
complete?_ we shall see that the first proposition in each sentence
is independent and the second dependent. But it may be said that in
each case the dependent proposition is necessary for the truth of the
sentence, that its thought must have been in the author’s mind not as
an addition to the main thought but as something indispensable. This is
perfectly true; logically the truth of the independent proposition does
depend on the thought in the dependent proposition, but grammatically
the dependence is the other way. Notice that in each of these sentences
the second proposition denotes a modifying circumstance of the main
thought, and therefore takes rank in the sentence merely as an
idea,--telling in the first sentence _when_ the Mohawk hardly feels
the scalping knife, in the second _under what condition_ success is
unworthy, in the third _which_ country is the fairest. Now, had the
author so chosen, these modifications might all have been expressed by
phrases, though possibly not so clearly.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Tests for Independent and Dependent Propositions.=--From the foregoing
we may deduce the following tests for propositions.

1. For the independent proposition.--(_a_) It contains the main thought
that the author wished to convey. (_b_) It is so expressed that it is
grammatically complete when standing alone.

2. For the dependent proposition.--(_a_) It expresses a modifying
thought of some word or words in the independent proposition. (_b_) It
may be changed to a simpler element, a word or phrase, provided there
is a word or phrase in the language to express the same meaning. (_c_)
It is not so expressed that it would make sense standing alone.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Function of the Dependent Proposition.=--From what has already been
said it may be inferred that the dependent proposition is employed (1)
for variety, in the place of a word or phrase, (2) for the adequate
expression of what we have no word or phrase capable of saying. But
this is not all. Every dependent proposition can be changed into an
independent proposition, and so might have been brought into the
sentence in that form. For example,--

 The Mohawk shouts his death song, and he hardly feels the scalping
 knife.

 That country is inhabited by the noblest minds and it is the fairest.

 Success should be won by honest industry and a brave breasting of the
 waves of fortune, and no other success is worthy of the name.

By comparing these recasted sentences with the originals we perceive
why the authors employed the dependent proposition; by means of it
they have shown what the recasted sentences do not show--(1) what is
the main thought and what is subordinate; (2) the special relation
existing between the principal and the subordinate thought. This
second point is very important. If we had to tell a story in sentences
of one proposition each, how difficult it would be to give the reader
an idea of the various relations between these propositions. Besides,
how tedious is a succession of single propositions. Compare, for
instance, the following six sentences with the one smooth, compact,
clear sentence into which they may be combined.

 The jay hoards up nuts for winter use.

 This is a general belief among country people.

 This belief has probably some foundation in fact.

 Where can the jay safely place his stores?

 One is at a loss to know this.

 His stores are apt to be pilfered by the mice and squirrels.

 The general belief among country people that the jay hoards up nuts
 for winter use has probably some foundation in fact, though one is at
 a loss to know where he could place his stores so that they would not
 be pilfered by the mice and squirrels.--_Burroughs._

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Combination of Independent Propositions.=--This comes about
when we wish to put related thoughts into one sentence in such a way
as to show that they are equally important, and that, although they
are related, neither is to be considered as denoting some modifying
circumstance of any idea in the other. For example,--

 1. There must be work done by the arms or none of us could
 live.--_Ruskin._

 2. Misfortune could not subdue him and prosperity could not spoil
 him.--_Dickens._

 3. You may talk of the tyranny of Nero and Tiberius; but the real
 tyranny is the tyranny of your next door neighbor.--_Bagehot._

Notice that the connectives in these sentences, while indicating a
relation between the propositions as wholes, belong to one proposition
no more than to the other, hence are not a grammatical part of either;
also that neither proposition is a modifier of any idea in the other.

It has been well said that often when we combine two independent
propositions into one sentence, we are really conveying three
thoughts,--the thought in each proposition and the thought suggested by
the relation between the two propositions. In sentence 3 just quoted,
we have not only the two propositions expressed, but two more implied;
viz., _the tyranny of Nero and Tiberius is not the real tyranny_; and,
_the real tyranny is not talked about_.

We are now ready to take the second step in studying the structure
of a given sentence, that is, to determine whether its component
propositions are independent or dependent.


Exercise 2

Select each proposition in the following sentences. State whether it is
independent or dependent, and give the grounds for your decision.

 1. Children play the part in the household which the king’s jester,
 who very often had a mighty long head under his cap and bells, used to
 play for a monarch.--_Holmes._

 2. Already I breathed gales of the everlasting mountains, that to my
 feelings blew from the garden of Paradise.--_De Quincey._

 3. The waterfall is comparatively narrow at the top of the precipice;
 but it widens as it descends, and curves a little as it widens, so
 that it shapes itself, before it reaches the first bowl of granite,
 into the charming figure of the comet that glowed on our sky some
 years ago.--_King._

 4. He, who, in an enlightened and literary society, aspires to be a
 great poet, must first become a little child.--_Macaulay._

 5. One has only to sit down in the woods or fields, or by the shore of
 the river or lake, and nearly everything of interest will come round
 to him,--the birds, the animals, the insects,--and presently, after
 his eye has got accustomed to the place and to the light and shade, he
 will probably see some plant or flower that he had sought in vain for,
 and that is a pleasant surprise to him.--_Burroughs._

 6. If their lantern had been in its place, they would scarce have
 failed to descry me, unless indeed I had seen the gleam before I
 turned the corner.--_Blackmore._

 7. The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Betsey Barker’s
 Alderney; therefore great was the sympathy and regret when, in an
 unguarded moment, the poor cow tumbled into a lime-pit.--_Mrs.
 Gaskell._

 8.     That was the grandest funeral
          That ever passed on earth,
        But no one heard the tramping,
          Or saw the train go forth.

 9. There were rows of houses which he had never seen before, and those
 which had been his familiar haunts had disappeared.--_Irving._

 10. In the morning I arose with the lark, and at night I slept where
 sunset overtook me.--_Longfellow._

 11. Kala Nag, which means Black Snake, had served the Indian
 Government in every way that an elephant could serve it for
 forty-seven years.--_Kipling._

 12. Your dull unhurried worker gets over a great deal of ground
 because he never goes backward or breaks down.--_Wm. James._




CHAPTER III

THE CLASSIFICATION OF SENTENCES ACCORDING TO STRUCTURE


We have seen that a sentence may consist of one proposition or of
several, and that all its propositions may be independent or one or
more of them may be dependent. This freedom of combination gives rise
to three distinct types of sentences, classified according to the
number and the kind of propositions they contain. These are _simple_,
_complex_, and _compound_.

1. _A simple sentence_ is one that consists of one independent
proposition.--“Lightness of touch is the crowning test of
power.”--_Higginson._

2. _A complex sentence_ is one that contains at least one dependent
proposition. It usually contains a complete independent proposition
also, and it may contain any number of dependent propositions.

(a) With the independent proposition complete,--“What inspiration
gilds his features as he descends the mount with the Tables in his
hand.”--_Lord._

(b) With the independent proposition incomplete because the
dependent proposition is its subject.--“That Chaucer, being at
Milan, should not have found occasion to ride across so far as Padua
for the sake of seeing the most famous literary man of the day, is
incredible.”--_Lowell._

3. _A compound sentence_ is one that contains at least two independent
propositions. It may also contain one or more dependent propositions.
In that case it is often called _complex-compound_.

(a) Compound sentence,--“It is a strange tale, but it hath the
recommendation of brevity.”--_Jerrold._

(b) Complex-compound.--“Times of heroism are generally times of
terror, but the day never shines in which this element may not
work.”--_Emerson._

=Difficulty in Classifying Sentences.=--It is sometimes difficult for
a beginner to determine whether a sentence is complex or compound,
that is, whether a certain one of its propositions is independent or
dependent. Take, for instance, two such sentences as the following:
“The ground is wet this morning because it rained last night”; and,
“The ground is wet this morning, hence it rained last night.” Out of
each of these expressions we get a statement of cause and effect,
but the two sentences are not therefore alike, for a sentence is to
be considered not only logically but grammatically, before we can
decide what kind it is. It is clear that in each sentence the first
proposition is independent, so we shall examine only the second.

Now, in the first sentence the second proposition is intended to
tell _why_ the ground is wet, just as the words _this morning_
tell _when_ it is wet. Why a certain state exists may be told by a
phrase as well as by a proposition, because it is only a modifying
circumstance. It might be told here by the prepositional phrase _from
last night’s rain_. If this second proposition, then, is put into the
sentence merely to tell something about some part of the independent
proposition, it is clearly subordinate, and therefore dependent.

In the second sentence the second proposition does not express any
modification of any idea in the first proposition. It states a
conclusion drawn from the fact stated in the first proposition, and
in the author’s mind the conclusion is of equal importance with the
fact that supports it. We may even supply the conjunction _and_ before
_hence_, which shows that the two propositions are coördinate, so if
one is independent the other must be.

It may be said that if the conjunction _hence_ is taken as a part of
the following proposition, the proposition cannot stand alone any more
than can the proposition introduced by _because._ But _because_ must
be taken as a part of its proposition because it indicates the special
modifying circumstance--not time, or place, but cause--which the author
intended that proposition to denote, whereas _hence_ is not a part of
the following proposition because that proposition is not intended,
as we have shown, to be a modifier of any part of the preceding
proposition, but a conclusion drawn from the whole of it. _Because_,
indicating subordination is a subordinating conjunction and always a
part of the proposition it introduces. _Hence_, indicating equality,
or grammatical coördination, is a coördinating conjunction and never a
part of the proposition following it.

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Partially Compound Sentence.=--Since there are three well defined
types of sentences, it is natural that there should be forms lying in
between any two of these types and partaking of the nature of both.
One of these forms, the complex-compound sentence, we have already
spoken of. Another form is found in the following sentence,--“The
diseases, the elements, fortune, gravity, lightning, respect no
persons.”--_Emerson._

Here there are several subjects but only one assertion made, hence
only one proposition. The sentence resembles both the compound
sentence and the simple sentence, but is, strictly speaking, neither
one. It is called _partially compound_, and may be considered a fifth
kind of sentence. Sometimes it contains only one subject but two or
more predicates,--“He shook his head, shouldered the rusty firelock,
and, with a heart full of trouble and anxiety, turned his steps
homeward.”--_Irving._


Exercise 3

Classify the following sentences according to structure, giving in each
case the grounds for your decision.

 1. I could never fathom how a man dares to lift up his voice to preach
 in a cathedral.--_Stevenson._

 2.     Great feelings hath she of her own,
        Which lesser souls may never know;
        God giveth them to her alone,
        And sweet they are as any tone
        Wherewith the wind may choose to blow.--_Lowell._

 3. When you emerge from the portals of St. Mark’s, you enter upon
 spaces of such sunny length and breadth, set round with such
 exquisite architecture that it makes you glad to be living in this
 world.--_Howells._

 4. Education, to accomplish the ends of good government, should be
 universally diffused.--_Webster._

 5. If a country finds itself wretched, sure enough that country has
 been misguided.--_Carlyle._

 6. These winds in the winter season frequently freshen into tempests,
 and, sweeping down the Atlantic coast and the winding Gulf of Mexico,
 burst with the fury of a hurricane on its unprotected shores, and on
 the neighboring West India islands.--_Prescott._

 7. The Puritan prostrated himself in the dust before his Maker; but he
 set his foot on the neck of his king.--_Macaulay._

 8. You get entangled in another man’s mind, even as you lose yourself
 in another man’s grounds.--_Lamb._

 9.    Not what we think, but what we do,
         Makes saints of us.          --_Alice Cary._

 10.  He reeled, and staggering back sank to the ground;
      And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,
      And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all
      The cloud.                              --_M. Arnold._

 11. Only the learned, who were very few, could read Latin; hence
 there came to be great ignorance of the Bible, and all sorts of
 superstitions and false beliefs took possession of the people, and the
 Bible came to be almost a forgotten and unused book.--_Munger._

 12. Wherever the Anglo-Saxon race goes, there law, industry, and
 safety for life and property are certain to arise.--_Dickens._

 13. The islands of the lagoons seemed to rise and sink with the light
 palpitations of the waves like pictures on the undulating fields of
 banners.--_Howells._

 14.  The heights by great men reached and kept
      Were not attained by sudden flight,
      But they, while their companions slept,
      Were toiling upward in the night.    --_Longfellow._

 15. Sweet funeral bells from some incalculable distance, wailing over
 the dead that die before the dawn, awakened me as I slept in a boat
 moored to some familiar shore.--_De Quincey._

 16. Terror, not love, was the spring of education with the

CHAPTER IV

THE CLASSIFICATION OF SENTENCES ACCORDING TO FORM


We have classified sentences according to their structure as simple,
complex, compound, partially compound, and complex-compound. There is
another classification made on the basis of form, which gives us three
kinds of sentences,--_declarative_, _interrogative_, _imperative_.
These three forms arise from the fact that there are three modes of
communicating thought; viz., by assertion, by question, by command.

=The Declarative Sentence.=--A declarative sentence is one that states
or declares something,--“Aunt Celia has an intense desire to improve my
mind.”--_Mrs. Wiggin._

This is the commonest kind of sentence, especially in books, for it is
the business of an author to inform his readers of his own thoughts,
not to inquire after theirs. It is the style of sentence best fitted
for relating events, describing objects, or making clear any difficult
subject. Its order is usually the natural one, first the subject and
then the predicate. Variations from this order will be taken up as they
present themselves in connection with different sentence-elements.

=The Interrogative Sentence.=--An interrogative sentence is one that
asks a question,--“Who now reads the ancient authors?”--_F. Harrison._

This kind of sentence is used often in conversation, both oral and
written. It is also common in addresses, such as sermons and lectures,
where the speaker asks questions of his audience, not for the purpose
of getting an answer, but that he may make a more direct appeal to them.

In books we often meet such an interrogative sentence as this,--“What
courage can withstand the ever-during and all-besetting terrors of a
woman’s tongue?”--_Irving._

The purpose of this sentence is not to inquire, to ask a question
of anybody, but to give emphatic expression to a thought. It is a
rhetorical device for making an assertion forcible. The author of the
sentence quoted was so positive of the truth of his thought that,
instead of declaring it, he put it in the form of a question, meaning,
however,--“There is _no_ courage that can withstand, etc.”

Interrogative sentences are of two kinds:

1. Those that can be answered by _yes_ or _no_,--“Can a man weigh off
and value the glories of dawn against the darkness of hurricane?”--_De
Quincey._

These sentences put in question the whole thought, and are usually in
the inverted order, the auxiliary of the predicate verb coming before
the subject.

2. Those that cannot be answered by _yes_ or _no_,--“Why should the
trees be so lovely in Japan?”--_Hearn._

These sentences put in question only one point, either the subject, the
object, an attribute of the subject or object, or some circumstance
of time, manner, place, cause, etc. They usually begin with an
interrogative word, such as the pronouns _who_, _which_, _what_, or the
adverbs _how_, _when_, _why_, _where_.

Interrogative sentences have sometimes the same order and arrangement
of words as declarative sentences. It is only by hearing them spoken
or noting their punctuation that we know they are interrogative; for
example, “Scrooge knew he was dead?”--_Dickens._ This is equivalent
to--“Did Scrooge know that he was dead?”

Before analyzing an interrogative sentence, its order, if inverted,
should be changed to that of the declarative sentence. Motley’s
question,--“When did one man ever civilize a people?” becomes for
analysis,--“One man did ever civilize a people when?” Notice that the
_time_ of an action is the point in question here, and the desired
answer will be this very same sentence with only two changes, the
omission of _ever_ and the substitution of a word or phrase signifying
a definite time, for the word _when_.


=The Imperative Sentence.=--An imperative sentence is one that conveys
a command,--“Tell me why you have brought me to this place.”--_Caine._

The command is frequently so mild that it becomes more a request or
piece of advice,--“Speak as you think, be what you are, pay your debts
of all kinds.”--_Emerson._

Sometimes it is even an entreaty,--“Give us this day our daily bread.”

A very common form of the imperative sentence is that introduced by
the imperative word _let_,--“_Let_ the dessert be served and the fruit
brought.” This generally expresses more of a wish than a command. The
same idea is brought out in such a sentence as the following,--“Come,
sit we down and talk.” Here the present subjunctive _sit_ is employed.
Both of these sentence-forms may be considered as substitutes for the
first and third person imperative, which is lacking in English.

In imperative sentences we use the imperative mood of the verb and so
usually dispense with the subject, the verb becoming thus the first
word in the sentence. For analysis the subject is to be supplied. It is
always a personal pronoun of the second person, _you_, _thou_, or _ye_.
The verb may be a simple imperative, as _go_; an emphatic imperative,
_do go_; or a progressive imperative, _be going_, or _do be going_.


=The Exclamative Sentence.=--Any one of the three forms of sentences
may become exclamative by mode of utterance, but the exclamative
sentence does not communicate thought in a way different from the other
three sentences, nor is it different in form, hence it should not be
considered a fourth kind of sentence.

A declarative sentence made exclamative.--“Alas! the silence which
was then settling on that aged ear was an everlasting silence!”--_De
Quincey._

An interrogative sentence made exclamative.--“Who could have imagined
the whirlwind of passion that was going on within me as I reclined
there!”--_Jefferies._

An imperative sentence made exclamative.--“Sit down, all of you, and
listen to me!”--_Lewis Carroll._


Exercise 4.

Classify the following sentences both as to structure and as to form. A
sentence compound in structure may have members different in form, that
is, one member may be declarative and another interrogative.

 1. A wide-spreading, hopeful disposition is your only true umbrella in
 this vale of tears.--_Aldrich._

 2. What is it to be a gentleman? Is it to have lofty aims, to lead
 a pure life, to keep your honor virgin; to have the esteem of your
 fellow citizens, and the love of your fireside; to bear good fortune
 meekly; to suffer evil with constancy; and through evil or good to
 maintain truth always?--_Thackeray._

 3. Stay, stay with us--rest, thou art weary and worn.--_Campbell._

 4. It is so tedious to live only in one circle and have only a genteel
 acquaintance.--_Higginson._

 5. Take Winter as you find him, and he turns out to be a thoroughly
 honest fellow with no nonsense in him.--_Lowell._

 6. In a word, if the world were actually all civilized, wouldn’t it be
 too weak even to ripen?--_Warner._

 7. Who blows to-day such a ringing trumpet-call to the study of
 language as Luther blew?--_C. W. Eliot._

 8. With what interest do we look upon any relic of early human
 history!--_Agassiz._

 9. Do not delude yourself with the idea that you can practice
 punctuality by and by, when the necessity of it will be more cogent.

  10. Boy as I am, I have seen battles too--
      Have waded foremost in their bloody waves,
      And heard their hollow roar of dying men;
      But never was my heart thus touched before.
      Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?
      O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven.
      Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears,
      And make a truce, and sit upon this sand,
      And pledge each other in red wine, like friends,
      And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum’s deeds.

  --M. Arnold.

 11. Whither can I take wing from the oppression of human
 faces?--_Lamb._

 12. But the third sister, who is also the youngest--Hush! whisper
 whilst we talk of her!--_De Quincey._

 13. But after all what religion knits people so closely as a common

 14. Shut now the volume of history and tell me, on any principle
 of human probability, what shall be the fate of this handful of
 adventurers?--_Everett._

 15. The self-made man is the funniest windbag after all!--_Stevenson._

 16. There! if the trout has a right to his grasshopper, have I not a
 right to the trout!--_Beecher._

 17. Let us trace a river to its source.--_Tyndall._

 18. Go face the fire at sea, or the cholera in your friend’s house,
 or the burglar in your own, or what danger lies in the way of duty,
 knowing you are guarded by the cherubim of Destiny.--_Emerson._

 19. Oh, child of France! shepherdess, peasant girl! trodden under foot
 by all around thee, how I honor thy flashing intellect, quick as God’s
 lightning and true as God’s lightning to its mark, that ran before
 France and laggard Europe by many a century, confounding the malice of
 the ensnarer, and making dumb the oracles of falsehood!--_De Quincey._

  20.
                                    Who could guess
  If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
  Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise?

  --_Byron._




CHAPTER V

THE ADJECTIVE CLAUSE


=Function.=--A common form of the dependent proposition is the
adjective clause, so called not because it is equivalent to an
adjective, but because it performs the office of an adjective, that
is, modifies a substantive. It is true that some adjective clauses may
be changed to adjectives, participles, or prepositional phrases, but
there are many more whose meaning cannot be conveyed by any adjective,
participle, or phrase at our command. For example, in this sentence
from Macaulay,--“In climates _where wine is a rarity_, intemperance
abounds,” there is no equivalent simpler adjective element into which
the clause could be changed.

Moreover, a clause gives more dignity and importance to the thought
conveyed by it than a shorter adjective element gives. Often, too,
a sentence loses in definiteness by the abridgment of an adjective
clause. For example, the sentence,--“The statue that was made of marble
pleased me most,” may be changed to,--“The marble statue pleased me
most.” But, whereas the first sentence means that the marble statue
pleased me more than the other statues, the second may mean either the
same or that the statue pleased me more than some other objects, not
statues. In other words, it is clear that the clause is restrictive,
while in the abridged sentence it is impossible to decide whether
_marble_ is used to restrict or to describe.

Another advantage of the clause is, that it does not require to be so
near the word that it modifies as does an adjective or a participle.
Take the following sentence,--“No act of oppression has ever been
imputed to him _which has not a parallel in the annals of the
Tudors_.”--_Macaulay._ Here the clause is separated from _act_ by the
entire predicate of the principal proposition.


=Classification.=--There are two kinds of adjective clauses, according
to the purpose for which they are used in the sentence.

1. The _restrictive_ adjective clause.--This is one which restricts,
or narrows, the application of the noun it modifies to some particular
individual or class.--“He _who_ _never changed any of his opinions_
never corrected any of his mistakes.”--_Hall._ Here the clause points
out the particular individual designated by the pronoun _he_.

A restrictive clause is doubly expressive;--it says one thing directly
and another by implication. In the sentence quoted the clause implies
that there are people who do change their opinions.

Usually the restrictive clause is near the word it modifies, is not set
off by a comma, and is introduced by the relative pronoun _that_, or a
conjunctive adverb, or such a phrase as _in which_, _by which_, etc. No
adjective clause, however, should be tested by any or even all of these
accidents, but rather solely by the purpose for which the author used
it.

2. The _unrestrictive_ adjective clause.--This is one that merely adds
a thought to some idea already expressed. The additional thought is
often valuable, but it is never necessary.--“The window of the little
parlor looked down upon the water, which had made friends with its
painted ceiling, and bestowed tremulous golden smiles upon it when
the sun shone.”--_Howells._ The clause here is evidently not used to
point out which water is meant, but to tell something further about the
water, something unnecessary to the truth of the sentence, but valuable
in giving the reader a beautiful picture. Such a clause is sometimes
merely a definition or expansion of a term already used; for example,
“Style, _which is the peculiar manner in which a writer expresses his
thoughts_, depends to some extent upon the age in which he lives.”


=Introductory Word.=--The adjective clause, being a dependent
proposition and modifying a substantive, needs some word to indicate
its subordination and join it to its substantive. This word may be
several parts of speech.

1. A relative pronoun,--_who_, _which_, _that_. This pronoun, besides
serving as a connective, is a necessary element of the clause. It may
be--

(_a_) Subject of the verb,--“The nature of his subject compelled
him to use many words that would have made Quintilian stare and
gasp.”--_Macaulay._

(_b_) Direct object of a verb,--“So I had arrived in Venice, and I had
felt the influence of that complex spell _which_ she lays upon the
stranger.”--_Howells._

(_c_) Indirect object of a verb,--“We must be as courteous to a man as
we are to a picture, _which_ we are willing to give the advantage of a
good light.”--_Emerson._

(_d_) Object of a preposition,--“Other men are lenses through _which_
we read our own minds.”--_Emerson._

(_e_) Subjective complement,--“He will never be the hero _that_ his
brother was.”

(_f_) Possessive modifier,--“Its members are inflexible men,
_whose_ ability has been as frequently manifested as their
patriotism.”--_Howells._

NOTE.--To ascertain the use of a relative pronoun in a clause,
substitute the antecedent for the pronoun, and observe how the
antecedent is used. Sometimes this substitution requires a slight
change in the arrangement of the words of the clause. For example, in
(_e_) above, the clause _that his brother was_ becomes _his brother was
hero_.

_That_, when used as object of a preposition, must precede the
preposition; as, “Have you ever heard the Lady--the one _that_ I sit
next _to_ at the table--say anything about me?”--_Holmes._

_That_ is frequently omitted when object of a verb or preposition; as,
“One of the shop windows he paused before was that of a second-hand
book-shop.”--_George Eliot._

_As_ and _but_ are sometimes used as relative pronouns; the former
after _such_, _same_, _as many_, and a few other expressions, the
latter after an interrogative or negative antecedent, and as an
equivalent of the relative _that_ plus _not_; as, “There is nothing
born _but_ has to die.”

The relative pronoun _as_ may be--

(a) Subject of a verb,--“I went up from the cabin followed by as many
_as_ could mount the gangway.”

(b) Object of a verb,--“Chaucer has left us such a picture of
contemporary life _as_ no man ever painted.”--_Lowell._

(c) Object of a preposition,--“He was such a schoolboy _as_ a
discerning master delights in.”--_Mrs. Ward._

(d) Subjective complement,--“I shall probably never see just such
another day _as_ yesterday was.”--_Burroughs._

 NOTES.--1. When _as_ introduces an adjective clause, the verb of the
 clause is frequently omitted; as, “Their military code bore the same
 stern features as their other laws (_bore_).”--_Prescott._

 2. The use of the relative pronoun _as_ after _as many_ has been
 extended so that we find it after _as few_, _as much_, _as little_;
 as, “She was done for and bought for ten pounds by the landlord of
 the Drummond Arms, Crieff, who had been taking _as much_ money out of
 her, and putting _as little_ corn into her, _as_ was compatible with
 life.”--_Dr. John Brown._

 3. The word _such_, which usually precedes a noun modified by an
 as-clause, may follow the noun instead; as, “The walls did not flow or
 subside to the valley in charming curve-lines, _such as_ I have seen
 in the wildest passes of the New England mountains.”--_King._ Instead
 of transposing _such_, which would alter the meaning slightly, we
 may say that it is a pronominal in apposition with _curve-lines_ and
 modified by the restrictive adjective clause _as I have seen_, etc.

2. A conjunctive adverb.--This is equivalent to a phrase consisting of
a preposition and a relative pronoun, and is used interchangeably with
such a phrase. Its function in the clause is the same as that of the
phrase, that is, it modifies the verb. The commonest of these adverbs
are _when_ (= _in which_ or _on which_), _where_ (= _in which_ or _on
which_), _whither_ (= _toward which_), _whence_ (= _from which_).
Others less used are _wherein_, _whereon_, _whereof_, _wherethrough_,
_wherefrom_, _wherewith_, _whereupon_, _wherefore_, _whereby_,
_whereat_. For example,--

 Our works are the mirrors _wherein_ the spirit first sees its natural
 lineaments.--_Carlyle._

 Some day you may reach that time _when_ a man lives in greater part
 for memory and by memory.--_Lushington._

  Yet all experience is an arch _wherethrough_
  Gleams that untraveled world whose margin fades
  Forever and forever when I move.--_Tennyson._

3. The subordinating conjunction _that_.--This is often used to
introduce restrictive clauses modifying a word denoting time. It is
equivalent to a phrase like _in which_; for example, “At last the
season comes _that_ the sixtieth minute is due.”

This connective is sometimes used instead of _why_ after the word
_reason_. It is frequently omitted; as, “The instant he understood my
meaning, he obeyed.”


=What the Adjective Clause modifies.=--The adjective clause may
modify a noun used in any relation, a personal pronoun, a pronominal
adjective, or any other substantive. Sometimes, instead of modifying
any single word, it modifies the thought expressed by the whole of the
preceding sentence, or by a portion of it. In such a case the clause
is introduced by the relative pronoun _which_. For example, “They had
comported themselves with such singular wisdom and propriety that
they were never either heard or talked of,--_which, next to being
universally applauded, should be the object of ambition of all ages,
magistrates, and rulers_.”--_Irving._ Here the clause modifies _that
they were never either heard or talked of_. In the sentence,--“His body
was of an oblong form, particularly capacious at bottom; _which was
wisely ordered by Providence, seeing that he was a man of sedentary
habits, and very averse to the idle labor of walking_,” the clause
modifies all of the sentence preceding it.

Sometimes in sentences of this kind the thought to be modified by the
adjective clause is summed up in one noun which is used as a part of
the clause, while the relative pronoun _which_ becomes a relative
adjective modifying the noun; as, “In 1835, Longfellow became Professor
of Modern Languages and Belles Lettres in Harvard University, _which
position_ he held for fourteen years.”

An adjective clause modifying a whole statement is sometimes placed
before that statement instead of after it. The clause is then usually
introduced by the pronoun _what_; as, “_What was worse_, he every week
lost more and more by bad money.”--_Jerrold._

 NOTE.--The adjective clause may modify a noun or pronoun in the
 possessive case; as, “The world is _his who has money to go over
 it_.”--_Emerson._

=Position of the Adjective Clause.=--Usually it follows closely the
word it modifies, but there is a type of sentence in which the clause
modifies the subject and yet comes next to the subjective complement.
The following sentence is an example,--“It was coffee and not wine that
I drank.”--_Howells._ _It_ is here a personal pronoun standing for
_beverage_ and modified by the restrictive adjective clause _that I
drank_. The sentence means,--The beverage that I drank was coffee and
not wine.

Peculiar sentences sometimes arise from this construction; for example,
“It is only birds of prey that fear danger from below more than from
above.” Here the clause modifies the subject _it_, and the sentence
transposed reads, “It that fear danger from below more than from above
is only birds of prey.” This sounds ungrammatical, but it is the
interpretation of the original sentence.

In regard to the position of the connective, it is commonly the
first word in the clause; but when _who_ or _which_ is object of a
preposition, the preposition leads, and sometimes the subject of the
clause precedes the preposition and the relative; thus, “The largest
class of vessels is the full-rigged ship, _the distinctive mark of
which_ is that it has three masts, all square-rigged.” This arrangement
of words arises from the objection that some authors have to using
_whose_ as the possessive of _which_. If _whose_ were substituted
for _of which_ in the sentence above, the clause would read, _whose
distinctive mark is_, etc.

Sometimes the antecedent of a relative pronoun is omitted, especially
if it is a personal pronoun; thus,

                            “Who drove
  Planted both feet upon the leaping share
  To make the furrow deep.”--_E. Arnold._


Exercise 5

Select all adjective clauses in the following sentences. Tell
classification of each clause, what it modifies, its introductory word,
and use of that word (if any) in the clause.

 1. Boy! bring to us the dish the like of which is not found among the
 viands of kings.

 2. How babies will poke those wonderful little fingers of theirs into
 every hole and crack and crevice they can get at.--_Holmes._

CHAPTER VI

THE ANALYSIS OF SIMPLE, PARTIALLY COMPOUND, AND COMPLEX SENTENCES


1. Study the sentence as to number and kind of propositions, to
determine whether it is simple, partially compound, or complex.
Determine also whether it is declarative, interrogative, or imperative.
Name it according to both structure and form. If it has been rendered
exclamative, state that fact.

2. If the sentence is simple, separate it into its two parts, subject
and predicate.

3. Analyze the subject; that is, separate it into the substantive used
as base-word and the adjuncts of that substantive.

4. Analyze the predicate; that is, separate it into predicate verb,
complement, and modifiers (provided the verb has these adjuncts).

5. If the complement is complex, analyze it by separating it into
base-word and modifiers.

 NOTE.--Do not talk about “complete subject” and “simple subject,”
 neither “logical predicate” and “grammatical predicate.” The subject
 is the subject; the predicate is the predicate. That ends it.

6. If the sentence is complex, containing an adjective clause, proceed
the same as in the analysis of simple sentences, analyzing the clause
last.

7. When the clause is given as an adjunct of some noun, state whether
it is restrictive or unrestrictive, and give its introductory word.

8. If any subject or predicate is partially compound, state that fact
before analyzing it.

Always proceed logically. In analyzing the sentence, “The city editor
laid a clipping from the morning paper on the desk,” do not say that
_from the morning paper_ is a phrase modifying _clipping_. Say instead
that _clipping_ is modified by the prepositional phrase _from the
morning paper_. In other words, get new elements by reaching out from
elements that you already have.

Always proceed from the whole to the part. Do not say that _laid_
is completed by the object _clipping_, for that is only part of the
object. The object is _a clipping from the morning paper_. After giving
this as a unit, or whole, separate it into base-word and modifiers.

Do not analyze a simple prepositional phrase like _on the desk_. It is
a waste of time. If the phrase is complex, that is, contains a phrase,
like _from the morning paper of July first_, it should be analyzed.


Model for Analysis

 The Merced Yosemite was created by the action of five immense
 glaciers, traces of which still exist upon every rock in the
 valley.--_Muir._

 This is a complex declarative sentence.

 The subject is _The Merced Yosemite_. The predicate is _was created by
 the action of five immense glaciers, traces of which still exist upon
 every rock in the valley_.

 The base-word of the subject is the noun _Yosemite_; it is modified by
 the adjective _Merced_ and the article _the_.

 The predicate verb is _was created_; it is modified by the
 prepositional phrase _by the action of five immense glaciers, traces
 of which still exist upon every rock in the valley_.

 The base-word of the object of the preposition _by_ is _action_; it
 is modified by the prepositional phrase _of five immense glaciers,
 traces of which still exist upon every rock in the valley_ and by the
 article _the_. The base-word of the object of the preposition _of_ is
 _glaciers_; it is modified by the adjectives _immense_ and _five_, and
 by the unrestrictive adjective clause _traces of which still exist
 upon every rock in the valley_; this clause is introduced by the
 relative pronoun _which_.

 The subject of the clause is _traces of which_. The predicate is
 _still exist upon every rock in the valley_.

 The base-word of the subject is the noun _traces_. It is modified by
 the prepositional phrase _of which_.

 The predicate verb is _exist_; it is modified by the adverb _still_
 and the prepositional phrase _upon every rock in the valley_. The
 base-word of the object of the preposition _upon_ is _rock_; it is
 modified by the adjective _every_ and the prepositional phrase _in the
 valley_.


Exercise 6

Analyze the following sentences. If the analysis is written, take
pains to arrange it well on paper. Divide it into paragraphs. Either
underline or enclose in quotation marks all words quoted from the
sentence. Use abbreviations. Do not write out elements in full if they
consist of more than two words. Instead write the first and last words
with a dash between them.

 1. Fear is a wonderful goad to remorse.--_H. H._

 2. A part of the citizens seceded from the main body, and formed a
 separate community on the neighboring marshes.--_Prescott._

 3. He is great who confers the most benefits.--_Emerson._

 4. After two hours’ march the cortege stopped at the end of the quay,
 where the Prince de Joinville had stationed himself at the head of the
 officers of the three French ships of war.--_Thackeray._

 5. How many men and women perform their daily tasks from the
 highest motives alone--for the glory of God and the relief of man’s
 estate?--_C. W. Eliot._

 6. No one is useless in this world who lightens the burden of it for
 another.--_Dickens._

 7. He lifted his enormous ears, gave a short trumpet, and for an
 instant wavered in his determination whether to attack or fly.--_Sir
 Samuel Baker._

 8. Simplicity must be the first element of literary art.--_Higginson._

 9. I touched him on the shoulder, at which he collared me and nearly
 knocked me down.--_Miss Mulock._

 10. Those were the days when a man could hold three small livings,
 starve a curate apiece on two of them, and live badly himself on the
 third.--_George Eliot._

 11. A woman kept the summer school, sharp, precise, unsympathetic,
 keen and untiring.--_Beecher._

 12. I hold our actual knowledge very cheap.--_Emerson._

  13. Then saunter down that terrace whence the sea
      All fair with wing-like sails you may discern.

  --_Jean Ingelow._

 14. Man hath no fate except past days.--_E. Arnold._

 15. How few men in all the pride of culture can emulate the easy grace
 of a bright woman’s letter!--_Higginson._

 16. And, what is notable, in no time whatever can they entirely
 eradicate out of living men’s hearts a certain altogether peculiar
 reverence for Great Men.--_Carlyle._




CHAPTER VII

THE SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSE


=Function.=--The substantive clause is one that performs some office
of a noun. It is not a mere substitute for a noun, however, used for
the sake of variety. On the contrary, it is seldom possible to change
a noun clause to a noun, and just because there is no equivalent
noun in the language. In the sentence,--“I fear that he will come,”
it would appear at first thought that the noun clause, _that he will
come_, might be changed to _his coming_, but this would change the
meaning; for the clause implies that his coming is not expected with
any certainty, while the expression _his coming_ implies that it is so
expected. Every time, in fact, that a noun clause is used, it serves a
distinct purpose, and it is safe to assume that in a well-constructed
sentence no other element would answer so well. Let us discover some of
these purposes.

In the following sentence from Burroughs,--“To what extent the birds
or animals can foretell the weather is uncertain,” we have predicated
something not of a person, place, or thing, that could be named by a
noun, but of a _thought_, the statement of that thought telling us of
an agent and an activity performed by that agent. Hence, by means of
the noun clause we can make predications of thoughts instead of things.

In the sentences,--

“Now one codicil in my general law of freedom had been that my
seventeenth birthday should not find me at school”; and, “The
consequence is, that the seven, or nine, or fourteen lines have a
marvellous aptitude at knotting themselves up beyond the reach of
skill and patience,”--we are enabled by means of noun clauses to tell
what the codicil and the consequences are. We might give a general
definition of such nouns by means of other nouns, but to tell what this
special codicil and what this special consequence are there is no other
way than by the use of the noun clause. Hence, by means of the noun
clause, we can make certain predications that could be made in no other
way.

In the sentence,--

“Whatever ornaments she wears are of massive gold,”--we have made a
predication of certain ornaments; but instead of enumerating them in a
long list we have designated them by means of a noun clause, brief but
more comprehensive than any list could be. Hence, a noun clause may be
used to designate things when we have no names for them, or wish to
withhold the names, or find it awkward to use them.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Uses of the Substantive Clause.=--As a sentence-element it has most of
the important uses of the noun.

1. Subject of a verb,--“_What is true of individual men_ is true also
of races.”--_Lowell._ Frequently, for the sake of a more pleasing
arrangement, the anticipative subject _it_ is used, and the real
subject, a noun clause, is placed after the predicate,--“_It_ matters
little _what virtues a man has_, if he is habitually inexact.”

A common type of sentence, similar to this, is one in which the
anticipative subject is followed by the verb _is_, next by an adverb,
or a phrase, or a clause, and then by the real subject; for example,
“It is chiefly through books that we enjoy intercourse with superior
minds.” If we say, “It is chiefly through books,” the question at once
arises, “What is chiefly through books?” The answer is, “the fact that
we enjoy intercourse with superior minds.” Transposing the sentence,
we have,--“That we enjoy intercourse with superior minds is chiefly
through books,” the verb is being employed in the sense of _happens_ or
_is true_.

 NOTE.--In the following sentences from Robert Louis Stevenson it is
 interesting to observe how such a sentence as the one just described
 comes about:

 “In the midst of this Babylon I found myself a rallying point; every
 one was anxious to be kind and helpful to the stranger. This was not
 merely from the natural hospitality of mountain people, nor even from
 the surprise with which I was regarded as a man living of his own free
 will in Le Monastier, when he might just as well have lived anywhere
 else in this big world.”

 It is evident that the pronominal adjective _this_, which is subject
 in the second sentence, stands for the second proposition in the
 preceding sentence. How easily might the following sentence have been
 made,--“It was not merely from the natural hospitality of mountain
 people that every one was anxious to be kind and helpful to the
 stranger.”

This type of sentence must be carefully distinguished from one given
in the lesson on adjective clauses; for example, “It is the universal
nature which gives worth to particular men and things.”--_Emerson._

2. Object of a verb,--“It is hard to believe _that we shall
get any good from exercise proportionate to the sacrifice of
time_.”--_Hamerton._ This is the commonest use of the noun clause.
Many of the verbs that take clauses for objects denote action of
the senses, the mind, or the emotions,--as _feel_, _see_, _hear_;
_believe_, _think_, _know_; _desire_, _hope_, _fear_. The clause is
very useful after such verbs, for instance, after _see_; for besides
seeing objects we see those objects performing actions or existing in
certain states, and often the only way to tell this is by means of the
noun clause. Often, too, it would be impossible to particularize what
we believe, or think, or hope, or imagine, or dream, without the aid of
a noun clause.

When verbs that take a direct and an indirect object are changed to the
passive form in such a way that the indirect object becomes subject, we
find the direct object remaining after the passive verb.

Active.--“He told me that the tide was rising.”

Passive.--“I was told that the tide was rising.”

In the second sentence the clause is object of the verb _was told_.

3. Objective complement.--“Understanding, that is, equilibrium of
mind, intellectual good digestion,--this with unclogged biliary ducts,
makes the Saxon mentally and physically _what we call a very fixed
fact_.”--_Lowell._ Here the clause helps to complete the verb _makes_
and at the same time tells us something about the direct object _Saxon_.

4. Object of a preposition.--“How utterly powerless are our senses
to take any measure or impression of the actual grandeur of _what we
see_.”--_King._ A noun clause so used is not always at first sight
easily distinguished from an adjective clause whose first word is
a preposition, but there are several points of difference. In the
adjective clause the preposition is a necessary part of the clause,
governing some word in the objective case, and its position may be
shifted to the end of the clause. The noun clause used as object of a
preposition is generally introduced by the word _what_, which does not
introduce adjective clauses.

The preposition governing a noun clause is frequently omitted.

(_a_) After the adjectives _aware_, _certain_, _glad_, _sure_,
_positive_, etc., especially when used as predicate adjectives,--“When
you saw a lad with that book on the desk before him, you might be
_sure_, without asking, _that he had deserved the master’s approval in
some way_.”--_Annie Preston._

If a noun were used instead of a clause after _sure_, it would be
introduced by a preposition; but it is English usage to dispense with
the preposition when we use a clause, though the clause certainly
answers the same question as the noun, viz., _sure of what_? In
disposing of a clause so used, say that it is brought in by the
adjective without the help of a preposition, or supply the preposition,
or supply the phrase _of the fact_, disposing of the clause as an
appositive of the noun _fact_.

(_b_) After such predicates as _is determined_, _is convinced_, _is
resolved_, etc.--“I am convinced _that every spring a large number of
birds which have survived the southern campaign return to their old
haunts to breed_.”--_Burroughs._

(_c_) _After_ the verbs _assure_ and _warn_,--“You very soon assure
yourself _that such springs are also fed by rain_.”--_Tyndall._

“He immediately discharged two muskets into the darkness, to warn the
enemy _that he knew of their presence and intention_.”

(_d_) After some nouns like _doubt_, _assurance_, _evidence_,
etc.--“Cæsar saw no evidence _that the gods practically interfered in
human affairs_.”--_Froude._

5. In apposition.--“We look not to the question _whether a man have
or have not children to be benefited by the education for which he
pays_.”--_Webster._ Here the clause makes definite the word _question_,
a noun of wide application.

We occasionally come across sentences constructed like the
following,--“What a man does, that he has.”--_Emerson._ The meaning
is,--“A man has what he does,” the noun clause _what he does_ being
object of the verb _has_. But in the original sentence the pronominal
_that_ is object of _has_, and this indefinite object is explained by
the noun clause _what a man does_, which is therefore to be called an
appositive. Such an arrangement arises from a desire to make the clause
prominent and also to hold the main thought in suspense until the end
of the sentence.

6. Subjective complement.--“In fact, the only difference between one of
these ice streams and an ordinary river is, _that the former moves very
slowly_.”

       *       *       *       *       *

=Introductory Word.=--The substantive clause may be introduced by--

1. The relative pronouns, _what_, _whatever_, _whatsoever_, _who_,
_whoever_, _whoso_, _whosoever_, _which_, _whichever_. When introducing
noun clauses none of these words have an antecedent, hence it might be
more precise to call them merely pronouns. Their office is more than an
introductory one, for they have a function within the noun clause, just
as relative pronouns have within adjective clauses.--“I wondered _who
the priest was that_ _wore it_.”--_Howells._ Here the pronoun _who_ is
the subjective complement of the verb was in the clause.

2. The adjectives _what_, _whatever_, _whatsoever_, _which_,
_whichever_, _whichsoever_. These are indefinite limiting
adjectives.--Tell me _what time it is_.

3. The words _if_, _that_, _whether_. These are ordinarily
subordinating conjunctions, but when introducing noun clauses they
should not be considered connectives at all; for a subject does
not need to be connected to its predicate, nor a complement to the
verb it completes, nor an appositive to the noun it explains. These
introductory words serve rather to put the clause into shape, to make
it appear as a subordinate part of the sentence.--“‘I wonder _if his
heart is any softer_,’ thought the Fox.”--_Froude._ “The truth now
flashed upon me _that my companion was a schoolmaster_.”--_Lamb._

The introductory _that_ is sometimes understood.--“It is true _all
things have two faces, a light one and a dark_.”--_Carlyle._

_Whether_ usually takes _or_ as a correlative,--“Chaucer did not waste
time in considering _whether his age were good or bad_.”--_Lowell._

4. Conjunctive adverbs, like _where_, _when_, _how_, _why_. These words
always modify some word in the clause.--“We need not say _how much we
admire his public conduct_.”--_Macaulay._ _How_ modifies the adverb
_much_.

5. _But_ or _but that_, being equivalent to _that not_.--“‘Who knows
_but in the end I may turn into a dog_?’ said the Fox.”--_Froude._

       *       *       *       *       *

=“There” used as an Anticipative Subject.=--We have already spoken
of the anticipative subject _it_, whose office is to throw the real
subject after the predicate verb. Another word used in the same
way is _there_; for example, “_There_ is no good reason for a bad
action.”--_Spurgeon._

This word is not the adverb _there_, for it conveys no idea whatever.
It does nothing at all for the meaning of the sentence, as is shown by
our slighting it in reading.

After the anticipative subject _there_ the real subject is almost
always a noun with modifiers, but it may be a noun clause; for
example,--“No, indeed, there is no wonder _that God loved the
world_.”--_Phillips Brooks._

The verb in these sentences is usually some form of the verb _be_. It
is not the copula so often as it is the complete intransitive verb
_be_, meaning _exist_. In the sentence,--“There are many kinds of sea
fowl that feed on fish and build their nests on the sea coast,” the
entire predicate is the verb _are_.

When the verb is a copula it is often completed by a prepositional
phrase denoting an attribute of the subject. For example, “There is not
a crevice in it where anything green can lodge and grow.”--_King._ Here
the predicate is _is in it_.

Other intransitive verbs are occasionally found after _there_,
as in the sentence, “There _came_ to the beach a poor exile of
Erin.”--_Campbell._

CHAPTER VIII

ANALYSIS OF SENTENCES CONTAINING NOUN CLAUSES


It is most convenient to analyze the noun clause last, even if it
is the subject of the sentence. As soon as the clause is mentioned,
however, as a sentence-element, its introductory word should be given.
Clauses within the noun clause should be disposed of after the rest of
the noun clause has been analyzed.

A direct quotation is frequently introduced into a sentence to
fulfill the office of a noun clause. In structure and form it is like
an independent proposition, but in function it is subordinate; for
example, “The first and last and closest trial question to any living
creature is, “_What do you like?_”--_Ruskin._

Notice that this sentence is declarative though the quotation is
interrogative.

CHAPTER IX

THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF TIME


=Function.=--All actions or events can be referred to some time--past,
present, or future. Frequently the whole significance of an event
depends upon either the time of its occurrence or its duration; hence
it is often desirable and sometimes necessary to tell the time when
an action takes place or state the period of its continuance. We may
do this by means of single words, like _then_, _now_, _tomorrow_,
_forever_, or by phrases, like _a long time ago_, _at the present day_,
_before supper_, _till the end of the world_. Frequently, however, we
wish to fix the time of one activity with relation to the time of some
other activity. To do this we usually employ a proposition in the form
of a temporal clause; for example,

  “The British soldier trembles
  When Marion’s name is told.”--_Bryant._

Here the action of trembling is said to take place at the time of
another action, the telling of Marion’s name. Notice that from this
sentence we get double information, (1) that two actions occur
simultaneously, (2) that one is the cause of the other.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Introductory Word.=--All time clauses are introduced by some word
which in itself denotes time, and which is chosen because of the
special meaning attached to it. This word subordinates the clause
to the principal proposition, and connects it to that part of the
principal proposition which the clause modifies. Most grammarians say
that this connective is a conjunctive adverb, and that it not only
connects the two propositions but also modifies the verb in the clause.
To us its grammatical office seems to be that of a mere connective,
hence we call it a subordinating conjunction of time. The several
conjunctions of this class can best be studied in sentences containing
them.

1. “_When a prisoner first leaves his cell_, he cannot bear the light
of day.”--_Macaulay._ Here _when_ is chosen in order that the sentence
may signify that the two actions occur at the same time.

_Then_ in the principal proposition is sometimes used as a correlative
of _when_ in the clause. _Then_ is not a necessary word, but if the
clause is long, _then_ is useful in informing the reader that the
principal proposition is about to begin.

2. “Man should forget his anger _before he lies down to sleep_.”--_De
Quincey._ _Before_ (sometimes _ere_) makes a sentence signify that the
main action occurs in time previous to the time of the action expressed
in the clause.

3. “_After I had learned to row in the gondolier fashion_, I voyaged
much in the lagoon with my boat.”--_Howells._ _After_ makes the
sentence signify that the main action occurred later than the action in
the clause.

Sentences in which temporal clauses are introduced by _when_, _before_,
_ere_, or _after_, only establish for us the proper relation between
two points of time; viz., that one point coincides with another,
is antecedent to it, or subsequent to it. If we wish to denote the
duration of a state or an activity, we introduce the temporal clause by
_while_, _since_, _till_, or _until_.

4. “_While they sat at dinner_, a great fire of sunset spread over the
west.”--_Black._ _While_ signifies _during the time that_.

5. “_Since you were at Oulton_, my wife has been growing
worse and worse in health, and more and more eccentric and
crotchety.”--_Shorthouse._ _Since_ signifies _from the time that_.

6. “_Till men have been some time free_, they know not how to use their
freedom.”--_Macaulay._ _Till_ signifies _up to the time that_.

7. If we wish to be exact about the time that something begins, we
introduce the temporal clause by the phrase _as soon as_, or _soon
as_, which phrase may be considered one connective,--“_As soon as it
is convenient to_ you, I shall be glad for you to leave this sombre
place.”--_Shorthouse._

8. _As_ is frequently used either for _when_ or for _while_.

  “The boat had touched the silver strand,
  Just _as the hunter left his stand_.”--_Scott._

9. If we wish to state exactly when something ends, we introduce the
temporal clause by _as long as_, or _so long as_,--“_So long as men
had slender means, whether of keeping out cold or checkmating it with
artificial heat_, Winter was an unwelcome guest, especially in the
country.”--_Lowell._

10. _Whenever_ means _at any time that_,--

  “Yet _whenever I cross the river,
      On its bridge with wooden piers_,
  Like the odor of brine from the ocean
      Comes the thought of other years.”--_Longfellow._

11. Clauses introduced by _now that_ denote both time and cause, and
it is often difficult to determine which of the two ideas is more
prominent. In the sentence,--“What do you think of your home _now that
you see it_?”--_Black_, there is certainly more of time than of cause,
for if the verb in the principal proposition were changed from the
present tense to either past or future, _when_ would be substituted for
_now that_.

       *       *       *       *       *

=What the Time Clause modifies.=--Since we use a time clause to
tell (1) when a state exists or when an activity is performed, (2)
the duration of an activity or a state, it is clear that the clause
modifies a word denoting state or action, namely, a verb. Usually
it modifies a predicate verb, but it may modify the verbals, either
infinitives or participles.

It must be noted here that modifiers vary in their closeness to the
word modified; and therefore in analyzing sentences modifiers should be
given, not in the order of their position, but in the order of their
closeness. In the sentence,--“One night, shortly after the coldest
weather set in, he lost his oar as he was returning to the island,” the
verb _lost_ is modified by three elements denoting time, (1) _as he
was returning to the island_, (2) _one night_, (3) _shortly after the
coldest weather set in_.

 NOTE.--In the sentence just quoted, the connective _after_ is preceded
 by the adverb _shortly_, which is put into the sentence to tell how
 long after the coldest weather set in, hence it is a modifier of
 the whole clause. Other adverbial clauses than those of time may be
 modified in this way; for example, The Puritans espoused the cause of
 civil liberty _mainly_ because it was the cause of religion.

It is interesting and instructive to note that other ideas may be
associated with that of time in a temporal clause. A clause introduced
by _until_ sometimes denotes result as well as time.--“Skirts grew more
and more bulbous _until it did not need more than three or four women
to make a good-sized assembly_.”--_Warner._

A clause introduced by _since_ may denote time and cause.--“_Since I
have begun to examine these expressive little brutes_, I have made many
profound observations.”--_H. James._

A clause introduced by _when_ may denote time and condition.--“_When
the eyes say one thing and the tongue another_, a practiced man relies
on the language of the first.”--_Emerson._


Exercise 9

Select temporal clauses in the following sentences, telling what each
clause modifies and what it denotes, also its connective.

 1. Hero worship endures forever while man endures.--_Carlyle._

 2. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the
 companion of my future life.--_Jane Austen._

 3. When the need of such an institution as Feudalism no longer
 existed, then it was broken up.--_Lord._

 4. Book in hand, he followed the service with one eye, while he
 admonished perpetually the boys to keep still and to listen.--_Besant._

 5. It absolutely startles me now he is in my mind, to find how plainly
 I see him.--_Collins._

 6. Their young men cut neither hair nor beard till they had slain an
 enemy.--_Motley._

 7.   We two had been since morn
          Began her tender tunes to beat
          Upon the May leaves young and sweet,
      Together, planting corn.--_Alice Cary._

 12. Now that her father was taken from her, she nestled to Graham, and
 seemed to feel by his feelings, to exist in his existence.--_Brontë._

 13. Even when they fail they are entitled to praise.--_Macaulay._

 14. The house keeper waited until the sobs changed to the regular
 breathing of sleep before she stole out.--_Kipling._

 15. Until a man can truly enjoy a draught of clear water bubbling from
 a mountain-side, his taste is in an unwholesome state.--_F. Harrison._




CHAPTER X

THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF PLACE


=Function.=--Just as all events occur at some time, so do they also
occur in some place. We have not many adverbs of place in English, and
few of these are very definite; for example, _here_, _there_, _yonder_,
_somewhere_, _anywhere_, _hither_, _thither_, _up_, _down_, _in_. Hence
we usually tell place by means of prepositional phrases, and we have
many prepositions of place, such as _above_, _across_, _along_, _amid_,
_among_, _around_, _at_, _before_, _behind_, _below_, _beneath_,
_beside_, _between_, _beyond_, _in_, _on_, _over_, _up_. The value
of the prepositional phrase denoting place is seen in the following
sentence from Longfellow, which contains three such phrases:

“It stood upon the brink of a little glassy pool whose tranquil bosom
was the image of a quiet and secluded life, and stretched its parental
arms over a rustic bench that had been constructed beneath it for the
accommodation of the foot traveler, or, perchance, some idle dreamer
like myself.”

But the prepositional phrase will not always serve our turn, for
sometimes we wish to denote a certain place by telling what happens
there, and to do this it is usually best to employ a proposition. This
gives rise to the adverbial local clause. In the following sentence
from Lowell,--

        “Where today the martyr stands,
  On the morrow crouches Judas with the silver in his hands,”

in order to tell the place where Judas crouches, the poet tells what
happens in that place, namely, that it is the place where today the
martyr stands.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Introductory Word.=--The local clause is introduced by the
subordinating conjunctions of place, _where_, _wherever_, _whence_,
_whither_, _whencesoever_, _whithersoever_. _Whither_ conveys the idea
of action going _toward_ a place, and _whence_ of action proceeding
_from_ a place. These two conjunctions and their compounds as well are
not often used by modern writers.

_Wherever_ means _in any place_; as, “Wherever the Anglo-Saxon race
goes, there law, industry, and safety for life and property are certain
to arise.”--_Dickens._

Just as _when_ in a temporal clause often takes the correlative _then_,
so _where_ or _wherever_ in a local clause is often accompanied by
_there_ in the principal proposition, as in the sentence just quoted.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Peculiarities of the Local Clause.=--Often a local clause denotes
condition as well as place; for example, “Wherever money is the
principal object of life with either man or nation, it is both got ill
and spent ill.”--_Ruskin._

Sometimes the idea of time exists along with that of place; for
example, “Where one person is really interested by music, twenty are
pleased by good reading.”--_Hart._

The adverbial clause of place is not common, and yet we frequently
meet clauses introduced by _where_, _whence_, etc. Most of these are
adjective clauses, and as such they have two uses, as may be seen in
the following typical sentences:

(1) “Being newly from a land _where everything, morally and materially,
was in good repair_, I rioted sentimentally on the picturesque ruin,
the pleasant discomfort and hopelessness of everything about me
here.”--_Howells._ The clause here is restrictive, used to point out a
certain land, and _where_ is equivalent to _in which_.

(2) “Dr. Livingstone, a Scotchman, spent many years in exploring
Central Africa, _where he finally perished_.”--Here the clause is
equivalent in meaning to an independent proposition, _where_ meaning
_and there_, but nevertheless it has the structure of a dependent
proposition.

       There is the true man’s birthplace grand.--_Lowell._

CHAPTER XI

THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF MANNER


=Function.=--A common question in regard to activities is _how?_ This
is oftenest answered by means of an adverb or a prepositional phrase;
as, sew _neatly_, study _diligently_, go _with dispatch_. But it is
to be noticed that these elements tell how in an absolute way with
no reference to a fixed standard, and are capable of many degrees
of interpretation, for people’s notions of neatness, diligence, and
dispatch differ.

Adverbs and prepositional phrases are unsatisfactory in another respect
also;--the manner of an action can seldom be characterized by one term,
so unless we wish to call attention to only one characteristic, we must
employ several terms, or leave the action incompletely described. But
if we use a clause we may tell exactly how an action is performed by
comparing it with some other action familiar and understood, which it
more or less precisely resembles; for example, “Sing out, children, _as
the little thrushes do_.”--_Mrs. Browning._ Here the clause conveys
one clear and definite impression to all who have heard the thrushes
sing, an impression that it would take a whole list of adverbs to
convey, like _sweetly_, _joyfully_, _thrillingly_, _spontaneously_; but
how like a catalogue these sound, and how little they appeal to the
imagination.

Frequently a mental action, an action of the emotions or of the
will, or something else not immediately intelligible, is made clear
by comparing it with something material, something evident to the
senses. In such sentences we find the familiar figure of speech
called _simile_; thus, “Poetry produces an illusion on the eye of
the mind, _as a magic lantern produces an illusion on the eye of the
body_.”--_Macaulay._ Here the clause of manner modifies the entire
predicate of the principal proposition.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Introductory Word.=--The ordinary connective of the modal clause is
the subordinating conjunction _as_, though its place is sometimes
taken by _as if_ or _as though_, both of which expressions it is best
to consider one conjunction. In the sentence,

  “The maiden paused as if again
  _She thought to catch that distant strain_,”

the clause conveys an idea of purpose in the maiden’s pausing as well
as an idea of manner. This clause may be expanded to read _as she would
pause if again she thought to catch that distant strain_, where the
clause of manner contains a clause of condition.

A clause introduced by _as though_ cannot be so expanded. “I will
invest your money _as though it were my own_,” cannot be made to
read--“I will invest your money as I would invest it though it were
my own.” This is proof that the clause has been thought of only as a
clause of manner, and _as though_ as only one connective.

Notice that when a modal clause is introduced by _as if_ or _as
though_, the action or state in the clause is represented not as real
but only as assumed.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Position of the Modal Clause.=--The usual position of a clause of
manner is after the predicate it modifies, but sometimes it precedes
the principal proposition and is made emphatic by the adverb _just_,
_even_, or _precisely_, used as a clause modifier; thus, “_Just as
we estimate the importance of a river--not by its length nor by its
breadth, but by the amount of water it contributes to the ocean_--so we
estimate the size of a city by the number of people it contains.”

When the clause is long and comes first, the principal proposition is
often introduced by _so_, a correlative of _as_ in the clause; as in
the example above.


Exercise 11

Select the adverbial clauses of manner, telling what each clause
modifies, and its connective.

 1. These poems differ from others as attar of roses differs from
 ordinary rose-water.--_Macaulay._

 2. The beggars and the wretcheder poor keep themselves warm, I
 think, by sultry recollections of summer, as Don Quixote proposed
 to subsist upon savory remembrances, during one of his periods of
 fast.--_Howells._

 3. The stars all seemed brighter than usual, as if the wind blew them
 up like burning coals.--_Burroughs._

 4.    And ever with the years
     Waxed this compassionateness of our Lord
     Even as a great tree grows from two soft leaves,
     To spread its shade afar.--_E. Arnold._

 5. And as the piety of Noah could not save the antediluvian empires,
 as the faith of Abraham could not convert idolatrous nations, as
 the wisdom of Moses could not prevent the sensualism of emancipated
 slaves, so the lofty philosophy of Aurelius could not save the empire
 which he ruled.--_Lord._

 6. The foreign merchants, manufacturers, and artisans fled from her
 gates as if the plague were raging within them.--_Motley._

 7. The Creole neighbors rushed bareheaded into the middle of
 the street, as though there were an earthquake or a chimney on
 fire.--_Cable._

 8. For, as there is a curiosity about intellectual matters which is
 futile and merely a disease, so there is certainly a curiosity which
 is, in an intelligent being, natural and laudable.--_M. Arnold._

 9. Dislike at first sight is more common than love, as discord is more
 common than harmony.--_A. S. Hardy._

 10. The will has great though indirect power over the taste, just as
 it has over the belief.--_Bagehot._




CHAPTER XII

THE ANALYSIS OF SENTENCES


We are now ready to analyze sentences containing adjective clauses,
noun clauses, and adverbial clauses of time, place, and manner.

It frequently happens that there is a clause within a clause. The first
clause is then to be treated as if it were a complex sentence, and
the second clause analyzed when the rest of the first clause has been
disposed of. In the sentence,--“He felt as if he would like to stay
till every ship that had sailed out of Monterey in the last three years
had returned,” the predicate contains a clause of manner introduced by
_as if_ and extending to the end of the sentence. In this modal clause
the infinitive _to stay_ is modified by a temporal clause introduced
by _till_ and extending to the end of the sentence. In this temporal
clause the base-word of the subject, _ship_, is modified by the
restrictive adjective clause introduced by the relative pronoun _that_
and extending through the word _years_. So we have an adjective clause
within a temporal clause which is within a modal clause.

 other arts.

 6. Seventy years elapsed before the papacy was restored to the Eternal

 19. We wish that whosoever, in all coming time, shall turn his eye
 hither, may behold that the place is not undistinguished, where the
 first great battle of the Revolution was fought.--_Webster._

 20. As an oak profits by the foregone lives of immemorial vegetable
 races that have worked over the juices of earth and air into organic
 life out of whose dissolution a soil might gather fit to maintain that
 nobler birth of nature, so we may be sure that the genius of every
 remembered poet drew the forces that built it up out of the decay of a
 long succession of forgotten ones.--_Lowell._




CHAPTER XIII

THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF CAUSE


=Function.=--In our daily experience we are continually meeting new
conditions, discovering new truths. It is human nature to be curious
as to the causes of these truths and conditions, hence there is
no question perhaps which is asked oftener than the query of the
scientist, the persistent question of the child, _why?_ So common is
this question that in our speech we anticipate its coming and answer
it before it is asked. When we make statements of facts or of our
opinions, we seem to foresee that we shall be asked _why?_ or _how do
you know?_--so along with our principal statement we give a cause or
reason for it.

Sometimes we are able to tell cause or reason by means of a phrase, as,
He trembled _from fright_, The wind must be blowing _by the sound_. But
the usual way is by means of the subordinate proposition; thus, “Peter
the Great caused his heir to be tried and sentenced to death, _because
he was a sot, a liar, and a fool_.”--_Lord._

       *       *       *       *       *

=What the Causal Clause denotes.=--1. It may denote the natural or
physical cause of some physical effect either in nature or in man;
as, “Journeys by individuals could not be undertaken without much
risk, _for there was scarcely a moor or a forest that had not its
highwaymen_.”--_Draper._

This clause answers the question _why?_ One variety of it, often
called a clause of motive, denotes something that determines man’s
choice, something that leads him to pursue a line of action; as, “He
discouraged commerce, not _because it was in itself demoralizing,
but because it brought the Jews too much in contact with corrupt
nations_.”--_Lord._

A clause of motive answers the question _why?_ or _what made him do
it?_ It can be used only to modify a statement about a human being or
perhaps one of the higher animals--something that can act from a motive.

2. The causal clause may denote the cause of our knowledge of a fact,
the evidence from which we draw a conclusion, but not the cause of
the fact itself; as, “The other bird probably grew to maturity,
_as it disappeared from the vicinity with its parents after some
days_.”--_Burroughs._ This clause, sometimes called a clause of reason,
answers the question _how do you know?_ or _what makes you say so?_

Notice that all these causal clauses denote something that was true or
in operation before what is in the principal proposition was true or in
operation. In other words, the causal clause denotes the source from
which something proceeds; the outcome or result is found stated in the
principal proposition.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Connectives.=--The commonest connective of the causal clause is the
subordinating conjunction _because_, but we often find _for_, _as_, or
_since_ used in its place. Sometimes _that_ is used; as, “And we wept
_that one so lovely should have a life so brief_.”--_Bryant._ When for
or because introduces a clause, we know that the clause is causal,
but _as_, _since_, and _that_ may introduce clauses used in other
relations, so the nature of the clause in question must be determined
by its meaning.

There are several phrases that may be used as conjunctions to introduce
causal clauses. These are _seeing that_, _now that_, _considering
that_, _in that_, _inasmuch as_, _forasmuch as_. These phrases should
be considered as one word, having the function of the word _because_.

The connective is often dispensed with entirely when the relation of
cause is very plain; thus, “One man goes four thousand miles to Italy,
and does not see it, _he is so short-sighted_.”--_Curtis._

       *       *       *       *       *

=What the Causal Clause modifies.=--When the verb in the principal
proposition denotes action, the clause modifies the verb, or it may
modify some participle or infinitive denoting action; as, “Work is
a thing done _because it ought to be done, and with a determined
end_.”--_Ruskin._

When the verb is a copula, the clause modifies the verb and its
complement, as the verb has not in itself sufficient meaning to be
modified. In the sentence,--“To John Inglesant, who had always been
devotedly attached to his brother, this display of affection was
delightful, _cut off as he had been so long from all sympathy and
friendliness_,” the clause modifies _was delightful_. In this clause
the position of the subordinating conjunction as is usurped by _cut
off_ in order to give prominence to those words. The clause may be
transposed, however, so that _as_, meaning _because_, comes first.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Position of the Causal Clause.=--Usually the causal clause follows
the principal proposition. When it comes first, being in an unusual
position it becomes more prominent and therefore more impressive, and
the principal proposition is also rendered more forcible by being
placed at the end of the sentence; for example, “_And as they still
continued to multiply_, there came forth the dreadful edict that every
male child of the Hebrews should be destroyed as soon as born.”--_Lord._


Exercise 13

Select causal clauses in the following sentences. Tell what they
denote, what they modify, and specify the connective.

 1. The modern schoolmaster is expected to know a little of everything,
 because his pupil is required not to be entirely ignorant of
 anything.--_Lamb._

 2. If we dilate in beholding the Greek energy, the Roman pride, it is

 among the evergreen groves.--_Bolles._

 5. But when I arose, and felt it, and knew it to be a culverin,
 I was somewhat reassured thereby, inasmuch as it was not likely
 that they would plant this engine except in the real and true
 entrance.--_Blackmore._

 considering that there were no great waves, and no storm to make

 other.--_Draper._

 beyond the grave, he did not pretend to expect it.--_Froude._

 14. Its discovery by myself and dog probably opened the door
 for ill-luck, as one day, when I peeped in upon it, it was
 empty.--_Burroughs._




CHAPTER XIV

CLAUSES OF PURPOSE AND RESULT


The preceding chapter treated of clauses bearing the relation of cause
to the principal proposition and denoting something true or operative
before the thought in the principal proposition was true or operative.
We have now to consider clauses which are the reverse of causal
clauses, namely, _final_ clauses. These denote something that is true
or will be true after what is stated in the principal proposition is
true. In other words, they denote an end or a consequence realized or
to be realized as a result or outcome of the statement in the principal
proposition. According to their relation to the principal proposition,
they may be classified as clauses of _purpose_ and clauses of _result_.

       *       *       *       *       *

=1. The Clause of Purpose.=--The purpose clause denotes an intended
consequence, which is to follow from the action or condition expressed
in the principal proposition; as, “If natural death seemed to be coming
on, they would cut wounds in their flesh, _that Odin might receive them
as warriors slain_.”--_Carlyle._ This sentence shows that the clause of
purpose answers the question _what for?_ and is put into a sentence to
explain or justify the act in the principal proposition.

It is evident that, since a clause of purpose denotes an intended
consequence of an act or condition, that act or condition must be
performed or brought about by some being capable of forming an
intention, hence the principal proposition states something, either
directly or indirectly, about a voluntary act, usually the act of a
human being. This is oftenest stated directly, as in the example above;
but occasionally we find such sentences as the following,--“The door
of Scrooge’s counting-house was open _that he might keep his eye upon
his clerk_.”--_Dickens._ Here the clause by no means denotes the door’s
purpose in being open, but Scrooge’s purpose in keeping it open.

The clause of purpose may be introduced by the conjunctions _that_,
_so that_, _in order that_. The negative purpose clause is introduced
by _lest_ (= _that not_); as, “We must both speak low _lest she should
waken_.”--_Brontë._

The clause of purpose is seldom met, not because the purpose of an
act is seldom told, but because it can usually be told more briefly
by means of the infinitive; thus, “Garrisons were established in the
larger cities _to keep down revolt and to enforce the payment of
tribute_.”

       *       *       *       *       *

=2. The Clause of Result.=--This denotes not an intention but the
consequence of the act or condition expressed in the principal
proposition; as, “The kingly power among the Jews was checked and
hedged by other powers, _so that an overgrown tyranny was difficult and
unusual_.”--_Lord._

The clause of result is often employed to tell the degree of some
quality or attribute, as in the sentence,--“Washington was so rigidly
punctual _that when Hamilton, his secretary, pleaded a slow watch as an
excuse for being five minutes late, he replied, ‘Then, sir, either you
must get a new watch or I must get a new secretary.’_” Here the clause
tells how punctual Washington was, but it does this by telling a result
of his punctuality. Notice that in the first example the clause may be
said to modify the verbs in the principal proposition, _was checked_
and _was hedged_, but in the second sentence it modifies the verb and
its complement, _was so rigidly punctual_.

The clause of result is introduced by _that_, _so that_, or, if both
principal proposition and clause are negative, by _but_ or _but
that_. These connectives except _so that_ are usually associated with
the correlative _so_ or _such_ in the principal proposition. This
correlative modifies an adjective or an adverb, and serves as a hint
that a clause of result is to follow. As an example of a negative
clause of result, we have the following sentence,--“The long, warm days
of summer never return _but they bring with them a gloom_.”--_Lamb._


Exercise 14

Dispose of all final clauses in the following sentences.

 1. The oak chooses the horizontal direction for its limbs so that
 their whole weight may tell,--and then stretches them out fifty
 or sixty feet so that the strain may be mighty enough to be worth
 resisting.--_Holmes._

 2. High forest-clad hills rose on every side, enclosing the river, so
 that its only method of escape was through deep rifts cut into their
 slopes.--_Bolles._

 3. Every pot made by any human potter or brazier had a hole in its
 cover, to let off the enemy, lest he should lift pot and roof, and
 carry the house away.--_Emerson._

 4. Leonardo da Vinci would walk the whole length of Milan
 that he might alter a single tint in his picture of the Last
 Supper.--_Trevelyan._

 5. Is the old Grecian spirit frozen in your veins, that you do
 crouch and cower like a belabored hound beneath his master’s
 lash?--_Kellogg._

 6. I find myself so much like other people that I often wonder at the
 coincidence.--_Holmes._

 7. He wished the other examinations over, that his own might come
 on.--_Shorthouse._

 funeral, and solemnized it with an undoubted bargain.--_Dickens._

 12. The new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get
 them, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might
 have all their riches.--_Old Deccan Days._

CHAPTER XV

THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF CONDITION


=Function.=--We are seldom able to make unqualified statements, because
few facts are universally true. On the contrary, we must carefully
hedge in our statements by certain restrictions, and a useful means for
doing this is the adverbial clause of condition. For instance, “The
knight ever came to the rescue of a woman in danger or distress,” is a
sweeping statement, and would instantly be disputed unless we add the
conditional clause, “_provided she was a lady_.”

Such a clause is often so important that writers place it at the
beginning of the sentence as if they wished to guard against
contradiction or misunderstanding, by putting their readers at once
into the proper attitude for comprehending their principal statement.

If we examine a few typical sentences, we shall see how useful is the
condition clause in a variety of ways.

1. “_If nettles and thistles grow in my cabbage garden_, I don’t try to
persuade them to grow into cabbages.”--_Froude._ Here the clause states
a condition which is to be regarded as really taking place. The idea of
time is also associated with that of condition.

2. “_If, in the least particular, one could derange the order of
nature_,--who would accept the gift of life?”--_Emerson._ The clause
here states an imaginary condition, but at the same time implies what
is the real state of the case; namely, that no one can, in the least
particular, derange the order of nature.

3. “I might have been a minister myself, for aught I know, _if this
clergyman had not looked and talked so like an undertaker_.”--_Holmes._
Here the sentence is so framed that the contrary of both clause and
principal proposition is implied; namely, this clergyman did look and
talk exactly like an undertaker, hence I am not a minister. Is it not
wonderful that by means of one set of words we may say two opposite
things, and not fail of being understood?

4. “_If I was ever weak enough to give anything to a petitioner of
whatever nationality_, it always rained decayed compatriots of his for
a month after.”--_Lowell._ Here the subordinate thought is put into the
form of a clause of condition, but at the same time we understand that
we are to find in it the _cause_ of the principal proposition.

5. “Middlingness is always pardonable, _so that one does not ask others
to take it for superiority_.”--_George Eliot._ The clause is here a
saving clause. It states the exception necessary to be made in order
that the principal proposition may be accepted as true.

6. “_If my friend was not a genius_, he was certainly a
monomaniac.”--_H. James._ This sentence does not mean that my friend
was a monomaniac provided he was not a genius, but is a brief way of
saying,--If you assert that my friend was not a genius, you will then
have to admit that he was certainly a monomaniac.

7. “She has met the equinoctials before, _if it is the equinoctials
that are beginning_.”--Black. Here the clause does not state a
condition for the principal proposition, but for some thought not
expressed,--this, perhaps: _and can meet this storm_.

In these sentences we have by no means shown all that may be
accomplished by the conditional clause. We have only indicated the
types of sentences most frequently met with in which this clause occurs.

       *       *       *       *       *

=What the Conditional Clause modifies.=--The conditional clause is
usually brought into the sentence by the predicate of the principal
proposition, and so must be looked upon as an adjunct of that
predicate. Sometimes, however, it modifies a gerund, participle, or
infinitive. In the sentence;--“She must have a story, well, ill, or
indifferently told, _so there be life stirring in it, and plenty
of good or evil accidents_,” the clause modifies the participle
_told_ after it has been modified by the adverbs _well_, _ill_, and
_indifferently_.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Introductory Word.=--1. The subordinating conjunctions _if_, _so_,
_unless_ (= _if not_).

2. The phrases _on condition that_, _conditionally that_, _in case
that_, _provided that_, _but that_, _so that_. These should be
considered as one word.

3. The imperatives _say_, _let_, _suppose_; as, “_Suppose you were
going to carpet a room_, would you use a carpet having representations
of flowers upon it?”--_Dickens._ Here the condition seems to be actual
and present, not imaginary.

4. The participles _providing_, _provided_, _supposing_. The first two
are especially useful in introducing a restriction.

Sometimes there is no connective, but the subordination and the nature
of the clause are indicated by the order of the words, the verb or
its auxiliary being placed before the subject; thus, “_Had I twenty
girls_, they should be brought up exactly in this fashion.”--_Lamb._


Exercise 16

Dispose of all clauses of condition in the following sentences:

 1. If I had my will, every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’
 on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a
 stake of holly through his heart.--_Dickens._

 2. Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with
 barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means
 justified by actually effecting that end.--_Mill._

 3. Education will not make people happy, unless it is directed into
 useful channels.--_Lord._

 4. The hall was open to all who came on condition that the guest
 should leave his weapons at the door.--_Besant._

 5. Should a man discover the art of transmuting metals, and present us
 with a lump of gold as large as an ostrich egg, would it be in human
 nature to inquire too nicely whether he had stolen the lead?--_Lowell._

 6. He made very few rules, and in case one was broken in spirit or
 in letter, the delinquent was set up on a high stool behind a small,
 long-legged desk, facing the school, and made to read from the bad
 boy’s scrap book.--_Annie Preston._

 7. If you would not be known to do a thing, never do it.--_Emerson._

 8. While you utterly shun slang, whether native or foreign born,--at
 present, by the way, our popular writers use far less slang than
 the English,--yet do not shrink from Americanisms, so they be good
 ones.--_Higginson._

 9. The Saxon is the man of all others slow to admit the thought of
 revolution; but let him once admit it, he will carry it through
 and make it stick--a secret hitherto undiscoverable by other
 races.--_Lowell._

 10. Had it been wholly serious, it would not have been wholly
 French.--_Higginson._

 11. If he was ambitious, his ambition had no petty aim.--_J. R. Green._

 12. Talents are absolutely nothing to a man except he have the faculty
 of work along with them.--_Lowell._




CHAPTER XVI

THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF CONCESSION


=Function.=--In the compound sentence,--“The whale is not a fish, but
we speak of the ‘whale fishery,’” we have joined two thoughts which
are opposed to each other, but we have made them of equal importance.
Now, if we wish to make one of them more prominent, and at the same
time indicate that it is true in spite of the other, we construct our
sentence as follows,--“The whale is not a fish _though_ we speak of the
‘whale fishery.’”

Here the main thought is _the whale is not a fish_, and by the form
in which we have expressed the other thought, we have shown not
only that there is an opposition between the two thoughts,--which
was likewise shown in the compound sentence,--but also that it is
strange that the two thoughts are true at the same time when they
seem mutually contradictory. This second sentence is complex, and the
dependent proposition is an adverbial clause of concession. It does
not necessarily indicate that two thoughts are opposed to each other;
sometimes they only stand in contrast; as, “While (= _though_) his
fame rests on his Meditations, as that of David rests upon his Psalms,
he yet rendered great military service to The Empire.”--_Lord._

We may define a concessive clause as one that concedes or grants
something in contrast or opposition to what is expressed in the
principal proposition. It modifies a verb or a verb with modifiers. It
varies but little in function, the slight variations being indicated by
the choice of the introductory word.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Introductory Word.=--1. _Though_ or _although_. This is the
conjunction oftenest used; indeed, all the other words or phrases used
are more or less equivalent to it in meaning. _Albeit_ was formerly
much used, and we occasionally find it in poetry now, but it is very
seldom used in spoken English or in ordinary prose composition.

2. _Whether_.--This word with its correlative _or_ is used when we wish
to say that a thing is true in spite of two other facts or conditions
which are contrary to each other; as, “The balconies are always
charming, _whether they hang high over the streets or look out upon the
canals_.”--_Howells._

3. The indefinite pronouns _whoever_, _whatever_, _whichever_; the
adjectives _whatever_ and _whichever_; and the adverb _however_. These
words signify that the clause is to be taken in its widest possible
application; as, “_Upon whatever career you may enter_, intellectual
quickness, industry, and the power of bearing fatigue are three great
advantages.”--_Huxley._ Here the clause means,--though you may enter
_upon any career whatsoever_.

4. _No matter._--This phrase together with the adverb _how_ is a
frequent substitute for the connective _however_. It emphasizes the
scope of the clause and thus makes the opposition between the principal
proposition and the clause seem greater; thus, “The guns can be fired
in any direction, _no matter how the ship is lying_.”

5. _While._--In some sentences this is nearly equivalent to _though_;
in others it carries with it an idea of time as well as concession;
thus, “Both Charles himself and his creature Laud, _while they
abjured the innocent badges of popery_, retained all its worst
vices.”--_Macaulay._

6. _If_.--When the adversative relation between the two propositions
is perfectly clear without being indicated by the connective, _if_ or
_even if_ may be employed in the place of _though_. A concessive clause
so introduced must not be confounded with the clause of condition. In
the latter _if_ can be changed to _provided_; in the former _if_ is
equivalent to _though_; for example, “_If the scenery failed to charm_,
the names of places did not fail to astonish us.”--_Bolles._

7. _Notwithstanding_ or _notwithstanding that_.--The former of
these is more frequently met with as a preposition introducing a
concessive phrase and meaning about the same as _in spite of_; thus,
“_Notwithstanding the increasing illness of his sister_, he was able
to enjoy some cheerful society.”--_Ainger._ But sentences like the
following are not uncommon,--“_Notwithstanding the wind was favorable
to each alike_, both vessels had deviated from the direct line and were
steering toward a common center.”--_Cooper._

8. A common form of the concessive clause is one in which an adjective,
a verb, an adverb, or a noun comes first, followed sometimes by
_though_, oftener by _as_. This order of words arises from our desire
to make prominent or emphatic some particular attribute; as, “_Strange
as it may appear_, even the baron’s jokes seemed only to render him
the more melancholy.”--_Irving._ Here the attribute _strange_ is
emphasized. That such a clause is only an ordinary clause of concession
transposed for a special purpose, with as substituted for _though_,
becomes evident by comparing it with the clause in the following,--

                        “Thy brow,
  _Glorious in beauty though it be_, is scarred
  With tokens of old wars.”--_Bryant._

Transposing this clause to the natural order, we have, “though it be
glorious in beauty.”

In sentences containing a concessive clause the principal proposition
is sometimes introduced by _yet_, a correlative of the connective in
the clause. _Yet_ is often used when the clause comes first and is
long. It is useful in calling attention to the fact that the concession
has all been stated, gathering it up, as it were, into one word before
the principal statement is made.


Exercise 17

Dispose of all concessive clauses in the following sentences.

 1. The Icelanders say that “Iceland is the best land the sun shines
 on,” though the sun scarcely shines enough to melt the ice in
 summer.--_Munger._

 2. No man, whatever his sensibility may be, is ever affected by
 Hamlet or Lear, as a little girl is affected by the story of poor
 Red-Ridinghood.--_Macaulay._

 3. If they were unacquainted with the works of philosophers and
 poets, they were deeply read in the oracles of God. If their names
 were not found in the registers of heralds, they were recorded in
 the Book of Life. If their steps were not accompanied by a splendid
 train of menials, legions of ministering angels had charge over
 them.--_Macaulay._

 4. And, again, while the Greeks rightly despised mechanical arts
 as much as the Egyptians, they did not make the fatal mistake of
 despising agricultural and pastoral life.--_Ruskin._

 5. Well-advanced as Hepzibah was, she could not remember when Uncle
 Venner had not gone up and down the street, stooping a little and
 drawing his feet heavily over the gravel or pavement.--_Hawthorne._

 6. On whichever side of the border chance had thrown Joanna, the same
 love to France would have been nurtured.--_De Quincey._

 7. Energetic men, whether they work or whether they play, put their
 strength into the work and their strength into the play.--_Ruskin._

 8. Darwin misses no step that the slow but tireless gods of physical
 change have taken, no matter how they cross or retrace their
 course.--_Burroughs._

 9.   Though the cause of Evil prosper, yet ’tis Truth alone is strong;
      And, albeit she wander outcast now, I see around her throng
      Troops of beautiful, tall angels, to enshield her from all wrong.
                                                            --_Lowell._

 10. Thought is thought, howe’er it speak or spell itself.--_Carlyle._

 11. She would not marry a coward or a braggart even if he were the
 owner of ten thousand acres.--_Lord._

 12. Father Salvierderra always said that it was a duty to look happy,
 no matter how much we might be suffering.--_H. H._




CHAPTER XVII

THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF DEGREE OR COMPARISON


=Function.=--In Chapter XI. we showed that the manner in which an
action is performed is often denoted by an adverbial clause. Now,
it may sometimes be denoted by an adverb, as in the sentence,--He
accumulated his learning _quietly_. But, in order to give force and
point to this adverb, it is frequently accompanied by a clause of
degree bringing in a comparison; thus, “He accumulated his learning _as
quietly as a stout lady accumulates her fat_, by the daily satisfaction
of his appetite.”--_Hamerton._ By comparing the quietness with which
he accumulated learning to the quietness with which a stout lady
accumulates fat, we provide a standard or illustration for the first
thought, and so make it clear and impressive.

We often wish to tell in what degree a certain attribute is possessed.
This may be done by a clause of result, as was seen in Chapter XIV.,
but we may also do it by comparison; for example, “Thou shalt be happy
_as heart can wish_.” Here the degree of happiness thou shalt have is
fixed by saying that it is equal to what thy heart wishes.

Number and amount often cannot be told absolutely but may be told
relatively by means of a comparison; thus, “Mrs. Patten had more
respect for her neighbor Mr. Hackit _than for most people_.”--_George
Eliot._ It would hardly be possible or worth while to tell exactly the
amount of respect that Mrs. Patten had for Mr. Hackit, but it is worth
telling how this respect compared with the respect she had for other
people.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Classification of Clauses of Degree.=--1. A sentence may assert that
two attributes are _equal_ in degree; as, “They were as timid and
cowardly as they were rebellious.”--_Lord._ Here the degree of their
timidity and cowardice is shown by comparing these qualities with
their rebelliousness, and the two sets of attributes are found to be
equal. The clause in such a sentence is usually introduced by the
subordinating conjunction _as_, and a correlative of this word usually
precedes the word in the principal proposition denoting the idea to
be compared. The first _as_ is an adverb, being an adjunct of either
an adjective or an adverb. It may be omitted, as was shown in the
sentence,--Thou shalt be happy as heart can wish.

A clause denoting equality of degree is sometimes introduced by _as
if_, which may be considered a compound conjunction unless we choose
to supply the ellipsis. In the following sentence from Henry James, “I
found as great a fascination in watching the odd lights and shades of
his character _as if he had been a creature from another planet_,”--we
may supply between _as_ and _if_ the words _I would have found_, thus
obtaining a clause of degree having within it a clause of condition.

If the whole comparison is placed first in the sentence, the principal
proposition is introduced by _so_ followed by the word denoting the
respect in which two ideas are compared; as, “But, as eminently
as Homer is plain, so eminently is the Elizabethan literature in
general, and Chapman in particular, fanciful.”--_Arnold._ The words
_so eminently_ are not necessary for the complete structure of the
sentence, but they add to its clearness.

A statement containing a comparison of equality may be denied by means
of the negative adverb _not_, so that the sentence amounts finally to
an assertion of inequality in degree; thus, “He is not by any means so
wise as he looks.”

2. A sentence may assert that two attributes are _unequal_ in degree;
for example, “The manner of saying things often makes a deeper
impression than the thing that is said (_makes_).”--_Brook._ Here the
impression made by the manner of speaking and the impression made
by the thing spoken are compared and said to be unequal in depth.
The clause in such a sentence is introduced by the subordinating
conjunction _than_, and is always an adjunct of some word in the
comparative degree, or the words _else_, _other_, _otherwise_, or
_rather_, the last being in reality a comparative of the Old English
word _rathe_.

When a statement signifying inequality is denied by some negative word,
the sentence amounts to a statement of equality; thus, “It is not more
certain that Sarah Gamp liked her beer drawn mild than it is that your
Englishman likes his poetry cut short.”--_Birrell._

In clauses of both varieties given above there is often an ellipsis,
the words omitted being those already expressed in the principal
proposition and hence easily supplied. In the sentence, “Mrs. Patten
had more respect for her neighbor Mr. Hackit than for most people,”
when we analyze the clause we must fill it out so as to make it read,
_than she had respect for most people_.

3. The clause of degree may tell not that things _stand_ to each other
in a relation of equality or inequality, but that they vary in the
same proportion; thus, “The deeper the snow, the nearer the rabbit is
brought to the tops of the tender bushes and shrubs.”--_Burroughs._
Here the rabbit’s nearness to the tops of the shrubs is said to vary
with the depth of the snow.

In sentences of this sort, both principal proposition and subordinate
proposition are constructed in the same form, but the principal
proposition may always be ascertained by questioning the sentence; for
example, does the foregoing sentence assert that the depth of snow
varies with the rabbit’s nearness, or that the rabbit’s nearness varies
with the depth of snow? Clearly, the latter. Indeed, it will almost
invariably be found that in a sentence of this kind, especially if it
be addressed to the eye, the second proposition contains the principal
thought.

Sentences of this kind are often much abridged; thus, “The more, the
merrier,” “The sooner, the better.”

Another form of the idiomatic sentence just given is one which makes
use of the connective _in proportion as_; for example, “People dread
to be thought unsafe _in proportion as they get their living by being
thought to be safe_.”--_Bagehot._ This can easily be changed to the
older form,--“The more people get their living by being thought to be
safe, the more do they dread to be thought unsafe.”

 NOTE.--_According_ as may be used in place of _in proportion as_, as
 in the following sentence,--“The Sonnets are more or less striking
 according as the occasions which gave birth to them are more or less
 interesting.”--_Macaulay._

Another form of this comparison is one in which the two propositions
are introduced by the prepositional phrases _by as much_ and _by so
much_; for example, “Look at the most vigorous species; _by as much
as it swarms in numbers_, by so much will it tend to increase still
further.”

4. A fourth variety of the clause of degree is found in the following
sentence,--“Night in the tropics, _so far as animal life is concerned_,
is as the day.”--_Drummond._ Here the group of words, _so far as animal
life is concerned_, tells the extent or degree to which night is
like day. It might be separated into the base-word _far_ modified by
the adverb _so_ and the clause _as animal life is concerned_; but it
does not seem to be the author’s purpose to institute any comparison
whatever, hence it is better to consider the whole group of words as
one element denoting degree, and treat _so far as_ as one subordinating
connective.

Sometimes a clause of this kind performs a double duty. It gives the
reason or ground for the main assertion and at the same time makes
that assertion somewhat doubtful; for example, “_As far as I could
observe when the meeting broke up_, they separated without remark on
the sermon.”--_Emerson._ Here the principal statement is based upon the
writer’s observation when the meeting broke up; but he implies that
his main assertion may not be true, for his observation may not have
extended far enough to warrant any certainty in his conclusion.

CHAPTER XVIII

THE COMPOUND SENTENCE


In our study of dependent propositions, we have considered in
the main the complex sentence. We shall now take up the compound
sentence, whose distinguishing characteristic is that it contains at
least two independent propositions. These propositions with their
accompanying clauses, if any, constitute the members of a compound
or complex-compound sentence, and such a sentence may be classified
according to the relation subsisting between its members. On the basis
of this relation we have the following classification:--

1. Members may be _in the same line of thought_; that is, they may
denote related events succeeding each other in time, or they may tell
similar things about the same subject, or the second may be added to
the first by way of supplementing or explaining it, etc. Sentences of
this kind are very common; as, “We consecrate our work to the spirit
of national independence, and we wish that the light of peace may rest
upon it forever.”--_Webster._

Connective.--For members in the same line of thought the typical
conjunction is _and_. All the other connectives so used are equivalent
to _and_, though they may have a slight additional meaning. These are,--

(_a_) The coördinating conjunction _nor_ or _neither_, equivalent to
_and not_; as, “Bolts and bars are not the best of our institutions,
nor is shrewdness in trade a mark of wisdom.”--_Emerson._

(_b_) _While._--This must be carefully distinguished from the
subordinating conjunction _while_, and from _while_ used to coördinate
but equivalent to _but_; as, “His lower limbs were sheathed like
his body in flexible mail, securing the legs and thighs, while (=
_and_) his feet rested in plated shoes which corresponded with the
gauntlets.”--_Scott._

A common type of sentence which it seems best to classify here is
one in which the first member is imperative, the second declarative,
and the two joined by _and_; as, “Tell me what you like, and I will
tell you what you are.”--_Ruskin._ This is equivalent in meaning to a
complex sentence containing a clause of condition,--“If you tell me
what you like, I will tell you what you are.” But, inasmuch as the
author used _and_ between his two propositions, it would seem that
he intended the condition to be equally important with the second
statement. Sentences of this kind have a directness of appeal to the
reader that gives them a peculiar force.

2. The members of a compound sentence may denote _contrasting
thoughts_; as, “In cities we study those around us, but in the
retirement of the country we learn to know ourselves.”--_Longfellow._

The second member often denotes a thought not to be expected after the
first has been accepted; as, “Boys are capital fellows in their own
way, among their mates; but they are unwholesome companions for grown
people.”--_Lamb._ This sentence reminds us of the complex sentence
containing a clause of concession, for it might easily be recasted into
one,--Though boys are capital fellows, etc.

Connective.--The typical conjunction for this sentence is _but_; all
the substitutes for _but_ are merely its various equivalents. These
are,--

(_a_) The conjunctions _yet_, _while_, _and yet_, _whereas_; as, “It is
no longer a reality; yet it was one.”--_Carlyle._

(_b_) The adverbs _still_, _only_, _nevertheless_, _however_. These are
conjunctions when used alone between independent propositions, adverbs
when associated with _but_. They all imply an opposition between the
two members; for example, “He is glad of his pay--very properly so,
and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without it--still,
his main notion of life is to win battles, not to be paid for winning
them.”--_Ruskin._

3. Members of a compound sentence may present an _alternation_ or
_choice between two thoughts_. In such a case only one of the members
is true; as, “Come down and help us, Rustum, or we lose.”--_M. Arnold._
If the first proposition here is fulfilled, the second will not be
true. If the second should be true, it would be because the first was
not fulfilled. Often, as in this example, the second member denotes a
consequence of something which is the direct opposite of what is stated
in the first member.

Connective word.--(_a_) The typical connective is the coördinating
conjunction _or_. Sometimes the first member is preceded by _either_,
a correlative of _or_. It may be remarked here that or is much oftener
met between words or phrases than between propositions.

(_b_) The adverbs _else_ and _otherwise_ when equivalent to or may be
used in its stead.

4. The second member of a compound sentence may denote a result of the
first, either a direct _consequence_ or a _conclusion_. In other words,
the first member may denote (_a_) the cause of the second member;
as, “They speak English there, so your difficulties are now pretty
well over.”--_Brontë._ (_b_) The evidence which supports the second
member; as, “He was not at church Sunday, hence he must have been ill.”
Such sentences suggest the complex sentences containing a clause of
real cause or a clause of reason; and owing to the causal relation
between the two members, it may seem at first sight that one of them
is a dependent proposition. But such is not the case. Each of them is
grammatically independent; for both are presented as equally important,
and the coördinating conjunction _and_ could be supplied between them
in addition to the other conjunction.

Connective.--The typical conjunction is _therefore_. We also find
_hence_, _wherefore_, _so_, _so that_, _so then_, _consequently_ and
_accordingly_, all of which are equivalent to _therefore_.

5. Frequently one member is added to another by way of _explanation_,
giving the author’s reason for making the first statement. It is
introduced by _for_ and usually preceded by a semicolon; thus, “Always
pay; for first or last you must pay your entire debt.”--_Emerson._

It is sometimes difficult to decide whether the second member is
independent or dependent, whether _for_ is a coördinating or a
subordinating conjunction. The tests for the independent proposition
must be these:--Did the author intend the second member to stand equal
in importance to the first? Does the second member add something not
necessary to the first member or affecting its meaning? Does the second
member express a thought not perhaps in the author’s mind when he wrote
the first?

       *       *       *       *       *

=Omission of the Conjunction in Compound Sentences.=--Often when the
relation between two members is perfectly evident, the connective is
omitted. This frequently occurs when the members are in the same line
of thought; as, “The place to observe nature is where you are; the walk
to take today is the walk you took yesterday.”--_Burroughs._

The connective is also omitted to avoid repetition when the sentence
contains several members, all sustaining the same relation to one
another. It should, however, be noticed here that authors differ in
their mode of punctuation. One author might combine two sentences into
one compound sentence by placing a semicolon between them, whereas
another would place a period after each.

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Number of Members in a Compound Sentence.=--In illustrating
compound sentences we have given those that contain only two members,
but it must not be supposed that the number is restricted to two.
On the contrary we often find three or more. However, these are not
often all of the same rank, and the sentence must first be separated
into coördinate members, then if these members are compound they
must be separated in like manner, and so on. Take, for instance,
the sentence,--“Genius is mainly an affair of energy, and poetry
is mainly an affair of genius; therefore a nation whose spirit is
characterized by energy may well be eminent in poetry,--and we have
Shakespeare.”--_M. Arnold._ This complex-compound sentence is, first of
all, made up of a compound sentence and a complex-compound sentence.
The relation between these two members is that of cause and result,
the second being a consequence of the first, as is indicated by the
conjunction _therefore_. The first of these members is made up of two
simple sentences in the same line of thought, therefore joined by the
conjunction _and_. The second member is made up of a complex sentence
and a simple sentence, the second being an addition to the first and
therefore joined to it by _and_.

CHAPTER XIX

THE CONJUNCTION IN SOME OF ITS USES


In our study of complex and compound sentences we have noted the office
of conjunctions, both subordinating and coördinating, so far as they
join propositions. But this is by no means their sole office nor their
most common one.

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Coördinating Conjunction.=--The abridgment of propositions has
been carried so far that we find the coördinating conjunctions, _and_,
_or_, _but_, joining words or phrases just as often as propositions,
for example, “The intimacy between man _and_ nature began with the
birth of man on the earth, _and_ becomes each century more intelligent
_and_ far-reaching.” The first _and_ joins the two nouns _man_ and
_nature_, the second the two predicates whose base-words are the verbs
_began_ and _becomes_, the third the two adjective complements _more
intelligent_ and _more far-reaching_.

There is nothing at all peculiar or difficult in this use of the
conjunction, for we naturally expect it to join any two like elements,
provided they have the same office in the sentence. Occasionally,
however, we find it joining unlike elements; for example, “St. Edmund
punishes terribly _yet_ with mercy.”--_Carlyle._ Here _yet_ joins two
modifiers of the verb _punishes_, but one is an adverb, the other a
prepositional phrase.

A common substitute for _and_ when it joins words or phrases is _as
well as_, the whole group of words having the value of one conjunction;
as, “Truth needs the wisdom of the serpent as well as the simplicity of
the dove.”--_Helps._ This conjunction has a peculiar force. By its aid
the sentence just quoted tells us not that truth needs two qualities,
which the conjunction _and_ would imply, but rather that, while
everybody grants that truth needs the simplicity of the dove, it is the
author’s opinion that she needs, too, the wisdom of the serpent. It is
wonderful that the substitution of this little phrase _as well as_ for
_and_ can make a sentence so different in meaning.

A group of words similar in office to _as well as_, but not so often
used, is _no less than_; as, “The first lesson of literature, no less
than of life, is the learning how to burn your own smoke.”--_Lowell._

Besides joining words, phrases, or propositions as the elements of one
sentence, the coördinating conjunction, especially _and_ or _but_, is
often found at the beginning of an entirely new sentence, where its
function is to show the relation in thought between the new sentence
and the one preceding. In such a position its office is not grammatical
but logical; for example, “_But_ month after month only showed the
king the uselessness of further resistance.”--_J. R. Green._ This
conjunction is sometimes reinforced by an adverb; thus, “_And again_,
Drake’s cannon would not have roared so loudly and so widely without
seamen already trained in heart and hand to work his ships and level
his artillery.”--_Froude._

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Subordinating Conjunction.=--Owing to abridgment we find many
sentences constructed like the following,--

  “Then safe, though fluttered and amazed,
  She paused, and on the stranger gazed.”--_Scott._

Here the subordinating conjunction of concession, _though_, seems to
join two adjective modifiers of _she_. These are _safe_ and the two
participial adjectives, _fluttered and amazed_. Of course it would
be proper to fill out the ellipsis and make a clause of concession,
_though she was fluttered and amazed_, but it does not seem necessary,
and we certainly would not supply anything if _but_ had been used
instead of _though_.

The subordinating conjunction _than_ is used in this way between like
elements oftener than any other, especially when it is associated with
the adverb _rather_; for example, “Commonly a light is for the eyes
rather than for the feet, and a lamp is to read or sew by rather than
to walk by.”--_Munger._ The ellipsis after _than_ may be supplied here,
that is, we may make the sentence read as follows,--“Commonly a light
is rather for the eyes than it is for the feet, and a lamp is rather
to read or sew by than it is to walk by.” But if the sentence had
been,--“Commonly a light is not for the feet _but_ for the eyes,” etc.,
we should say that _but_ joins the two phrases and that the first one
is modified by _not_. So in the original sentence we may say that the
first _than_ joins the two prepositional phrases _for the eyes_ and
_for the feet_, while the second joins the infinitives _to read or sew
by_ and _to walk by_. _Rather_ is then an adverb modifying in one case
the phrase _for the eyes_, and in the other the infinitives _to read or
sew by_.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Correlatives.=--The correlatives _when ... then_, _where ... there_,
_so ... as_, _as ... as_, _though ... yet_, _whether ... or_, have been
sufficiently noted in previous lessons. There remains something to be
said about the familiar pairs _either ... or_, _neither ... nor_, _both
... and_, _not only ... but_. The first three pairs are alike in use,
the second word in each case, _or_, _nor_, _and_, being the connective,
and the first no part of speech whatever. _Either_, _neither_ and
_both_, when correlatives, merely hint that the real conjunction is
coming. The correct position of these words is immediately before the
first of the two elements joined by the conjunction. _Either_ and
_both_ may be omitted without affecting either the meaning or the
structure of the sentence.

These correlatives are found with verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
phrases, or propositions either independent or dependent; for
example, “Generally, good useful work, whether of the hand or the
head, is either ill-paid or not paid at all.”--_Ruskin._ “He neither
pretended to high blood nor in good truth cared one fig about the
matter.”--_Lamb._ “There is a working class--strong and happy--among
both rich and poor.”

The correlatives _not only ... but_ are different in some respects
from the others. _But_ is the conjunction, and _only_ is an adjective
or adverb modifying the first of the two words joined by _but_, while
_not_ makes this word negative; thus, “Longfellow has not only charmed
the ear, but has touched the heart of the world.” In this sentence
_but_ joins the two predicates. The first predicate is modified by
_only_ and then denied by the negative adverb _not_. In this use
_but_ is not an adversative conjunction, that is, it does not signify
any opposition between the two predicates. The sentence means that
Longfellow has done two things which are in the same line of action--he
has charmed the ear of the world and in addition has touched its heart.

It is not uncommon for _but_ to be reinforced by the adverb _also_; for
example, “Punctuality should be made not only a point of courtesy, but
also a point of conscience.”

CHAPTER XX

THE INFINITIVE PHRASE


=Nature of the Infinitive.=--In the preceding lessons, we have studied
but one element of the sentence; namely, the proposition. This
combination of subject and predicate we have looked at from the point
of view of its value as a sentence element, and we have found that in
the communication of thought it is of the utmost importance by reason
of its clearness. In this respect it is superior to other simpler and
briefer elements, but nevertheless in the development of English prose
we find the proposition steadily superseded, wherever possible, by
several of the simpler elements. This is the result of an ever-growing
tendency toward brevity and conciseness. In a recent monograph
entitled “The History of the English Paragraph,” the author states
that the English sentence has decreased in length at least one-half
in three hundred years, and that it has shown very great decrease in
formal predication. The means by which predication is avoided without
sacrificing clearness are various. One of them, is the infinitive
phrase, which we shall make the subject of this chapter.

By an infinitive phrase we mean a group of words of which an infinitive
is the base, the whole group being the equivalent of a clause and
forming an element of a sentence. It is an element employed so
frequently that it is very easily interpreted, and its great advantage
is that it enables us to dispense with a subject and predicate.

The infinitive is a verb-form differing from the finite verb in
this,--it expresses the action or state denoted by the verb without
the limitations of person and number, hence it cannot predicate.
It is defined by grammarians as a verbal noun. This does not mean,
however, that it always has the use of a noun, but rather that it has
the nature of a noun in this important respect, that it _names_ the
action or state denoted by the verb. Just as a noun may be employed as
an adjective or an adverb, thus, “I have a _gold_ watch,” “I am going
_home_,” and still retain its essential characteristic, that of being a
name-word, so the infinitive may be used adjectively or adverbially and
still be the name of an action or state. The infinitive also retains
its verb nature so far as to take any of the modifiers or complements
of the verb; for example, in the sentence,--“To furl a sail is to roll
it up and secure it,” the subject is the infinitive phrase _to furl a
sail_, the base of which is the infinitive _to furl_. Now in so far as
_to furl_ is subject it has the use of a noun; it has the nature of
a noun, too, in naming an act; but it also has the nature of a verb
insomuch as it denotes action performed upon the object _sail_.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Forms of the Infinitive.=--There are two infinitives, the root
infinitive, or infinitive with _to_,--_to see_, _to run_, _to be_,--and
the gerund, or infinitive in _-ing_,--_seeing_, _running_, _being_. We
shall study first the root infinitive. Besides the simple form, _to
see_, called the present active infinitive, there is the perfect active
infinitive, _to have seen_, and the corresponding passive forms, _to be
seen_ and _to have been seen_. We may also add the active progressive
forms, _to be seeing_ and _to have been seeing_. Intransitive verbs of
course lack the passive forms. Of all these forms the one most used in
the communication of thought is the simplest one of all, the present
active.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Uses of the Infinitive.=--The infinitive is used for many different
purposes, but nearly always in relation to some word whose meaning it
serves to make more clear and without which it would not be in the
sentence at all. These relations of the infinitive to other words may
perhaps be most clearly explained if we consider them in groups; (1)
its relation to the noun, (2) to the verb, (3) to the adjective or
adverb.

I. A noun may have an infinitive associated with it in two ways:--

1. As an adjective; as, “Leaves have their time _to fall_.”--_Mrs.
Hemans._ Here the infinitive is brought into the sentence by the noun
_time_, to specify what time the leaves have. The expression _time to
fall_ means _falling time_ or _time for falling_. In the following
sentence from Carlyle,--“He that speaks what is really in him will
find men _to listen_,” the infinitive defines the noun _men_, being
equivalent to the restrictive adjective clause _who will listen_, so we
must say of the infinitive that it is used like an adjective modifying
_men_. It is better than the clause, being simpler and briefer.

2. As a noun in apposition; as, “He had formed the heroic resolution
_to defend the tower alone against the enemy_.” Here the infinitive
phrase is associated with the noun _resolution_, but instead of
defining or qualifying _resolution_, it tells exactly what the
resolution is, and so is used as a noun. Moreover, we can make a
sentence by putting the verb _is_ between the noun _resolution_ and the
infinitive phrase; as, “His resolution is to defend the tower,” etc.
This sentence is true, and means that the subject and the complement
of the verb are two names for the same thing. When the infinitive is
used with the noun as an adjective we cannot make such a sentence as
the above; for example, we cannot say _men are to listen_, meaning
that _men_ and _to listen_ are equivalent. Of course few nouns can be
explained by an infinitive in apposition; no such noun, for instance,
as _city_, _man_, _book_, _tree_, but such nouns as _wish_, _promise_,
_luck_, _intention_, _task_.

This use of the infinitive reminds us of a substantive clause in
apposition. In fact, both the adjective infinitive and the appositive
are substitutes for clauses, the former taking the place of a
restrictive adjective clause, the latter of either an unrestrictive
adjective clause or a substantive clause.

In the sentence, “This is a day _on which to travel_,” we have an
infinitive phrase made from an adjective clause and still retaining the
relative pronoun. The relative has an antecedent but does not join to
it as usual a dependent proposition.

 NOTE.--When we say that an infinitive is used as an adjective or a
 noun, we do not mean for an instant that it takes the place of any
 adjective or noun in the language. So far from this being the case,
 the infinitive is employed simply because there are no nouns or
 adjectives to say what the infinitive says for us.

II. The infinitive may be related to a verb in various ways.

1. As subject; as, “_To pass this bridge_ was the severest
trial.”--_Irving._ If we ask, what was the severest trial? the answer
is the whole phrase, _to pass this bridge_; but the base of this phrase
is the infinitive _to pass_, hence it is the essential subject.

A common way of using the infinitive as subject is that arrangement by
means of the anticipative subject _it_, which enables us to put the
real subject after the verb; as, “It is a most earnest thing to be
alive in this world.”--_Carlyle._

 NOTE.--Some grammarians prefer to call _it_ a neuter personal pronoun,
 subject of the verb, and the infinitive its appositive, or explanatory
 modifier.

2. As complement.

(_a_) Object of a transitive verb. Not all transitive verbs can take
infinitives for objects. Most of those that do are verbs denoting
some activity of the feelings or the will; as, “He _resolved_ to go”;
“They _hoped_ to surprise this post.” The infinitives here answer
the questions, resolved what? hoped what? They are equivalent to
substantive clauses,--He resolved _that he would go_, they hoped _that
they might surprise this post_; but when the action denoted by the
infinitive is to be performed by the same person as that denoted by the
subject of the predicate verb, the infinitive is chosen instead of the
clause. It is simpler than the clause and has become by frequent use
equally clear. When the two actors are different, two subjects must be
expressed, hence the clause is employed; for example, They resolved
that _I_ should go; They hoped that _their allies_ would surprise this
post.

 NOTE.--The contraction of a noun clause to an infinitive phrase is
 very evident in such a sentence as this,--“He did not know _what to
 say_.” The word _what_ leads us to expect a subject and predicate
 to follow, but we have merely an infinitive. The second subject if
 expressed would be _he_, the same as that of the principal verb.

Verbs signifying _begin_, _continue_, or _cease_ frequently take an
infinitive for object; as, “As he approached the stream, his heart
began _to thump_.”--_Irving._

The verb _ought_ is always followed by an infinitive, which is clearly
seen to be its object when we remember that _ought_ is an old past
tense of the verb _owe_; as, “The founder of this stately mansion
ought surely to have stood in his own hall and to have offered the
first welcome to so many eminent personages.”--_Hawthorne._ Here the
obligation owed by the founder is specified by the two infinitive
phrases.

A use similar to the above is that of the infinitive after _have_;
as, “My friend, the Poet, tells, me he has to leave town whenever the
anniversaries come round.”--_Holmes._ _Have_ means _to possess_, or _be
under an obligation_.

 NOTE.--The construction, “I had rather go than stay,” may be explained
 by treating _go_ as an infinitive without the sign _to_ used as object
 of the transitive verb _had_. Expanded the sentence reads, “I had to
 go rather than I had to stay.” The constructions, “I had sooner go
 than stay,” and, “I had as lief go as stay,” may be explained in the
 same way.

After _dare_, _need_, and _please_ the sign of the infinitive _to_ is
usually omitted; for example, “I dare _do_ all that may become a man.”
_Dare_ and _need_ are often used with a subject in the third person
singular, whereas we should expect _dares_ and _needs_; thus, “He need
not be angry about it.”

(_b_) As part of a double object of a transitive verb. We have just
said that if one person _resolves_ that another person shall act, or
_hopes_ he will, the fact may be told by using a substantive clause;
as, “I resolved that John should go.” But if I expected that John
would go I could tell it by using an infinitive; thus, “I expected
_John to go_.” This is a matter settled by usage; some verbs must be
followed by a clause object, while others may be followed by a noun
and an infinitive. We call the noun (or pronoun) and the infinitive a
double object. It is not two objects; it is one object the same as a
clause, but it consists of two essential parts closely related. The
logical relation between _John_ and _to go_ in the sentence above is
that of subject and predicate; but grammatically _to go_ cannot be a
predicate because the infinitive does not assert. In this construction
the infinitive is related first to the noun _John_ and then together
with _John_ to the transitive verb _expected_. Sufficient proof that
the two elements _John_ and _to go_ constitute the one direct object of
_expected_ is found in the fact that it takes both of them to answer
the question _expected what?_ For we did not expect John, nor did we
expect to go. Furthermore, the two elements may be changed to the
equivalent noun clause, _that John would go_, in which _John_ becomes
subject and the infinitive becomes a finite verb, the predicate of
_John_.

This use must be carefully distinguished from that of the infinitive
in such a sentence as this,--“He bought apples to eat.” Here _apples_
alone answers the question _bought what?_ It is also plain that
the relation between _apples_ and _to eat_ is not that of subject
and predicate. Besides, if this sentence were expanded, merely the
infinitive would be changed to a clause. This might be an adverbial
clause,--“He bought apples _that he might eat them_”; or an adjective
clause,--“He bought apples _that were good for eating_.”

Another sentence not so easily discriminated is this.--“I told John
to go.” Here there is what seems to be a double object, but in reality
_to go_ is the direct object and _John_ is an indirect object, as
in the sentence, “I told John a story.” If we recast the sentence,
employing a substantive clause, we have,--“I told John that he should
go,” where _John_ remains as indirect object and the infinitive alone
is expanded to the object clause. It is the same often after such a
verb as _order_; for example, “He ordered the men to march”; but in the
sentence, “He ordered the message to be sent,” there is a true double
object. _Men_ is indirect object, because it names those to whom the
order was given, but _message_ does not name anything to which an order
was given,--it merely tells what was to be sent. The sentences expanded
read,--“He ordered the men that they should march,” and “He ordered
that the message should be sent.”

We may conclude that when verbs with the notion of _telling_ in them,
as _urge_, _beg_, _entreat_, _persuade_, etc., are followed by a
personal word and an infinitive,--as, “He urged me to go,” we must
carefully determine whether the personal word is more closely related
to the predicate verb or to the infinitive. If we find it more closely
related to the predicate verb, we must call it an indirect object,
and say that the infinitive needs no word for subject because it is
understood that the subject of the infinitive is the same word as that
used for indirect object.

The verbs most commonly followed by the double object are,--(_a_) verbs
of perception, like _see_, _hear_, _notice_; for example, “Then, on
either hand, I saw stately palaces rise gray and lofty from the dark
waters.”--_Howells_; (_b_) verbs of permitting or causing, like _make_,
_have_, _let_; as, “‘Why, what would you have me do with you?’ said
the man.”--_Froude_; (_c_) verbs of feeling, like _wish_, _desire_,
_expect_; as, “Why, they all want him to get up and make speeches, or
songs, or toasts.”--_Holmes._

(_c_) As complement of an intransitive verb; as, “The art of reading
is _to skip judiciously_.”--_Hamerton._ “For a long time the house has
been _to let_.”--_Barrie._ The infinitive is plainly a completing term
in both cases, but in the first it denotes identity with the subject,
hence has the use of a noun complement; while in the second it tells
the condition of the house, like the word _vacant_, and hence has the
use of a predicate adjective. Sometimes it is possible to change the
infinitive to an equivalent adjective; as, “The accident is _to be
deplored_,” or, “is _deplorable_.”

_Seem_ and _appear_ as well as forms of the verb _be_ are followed
by this adjective infinitive. It is especially useful in denoting an
action that is to take place in the future; thus, “He is to come soon.”

 NOTE.--Some of the difficulty in disposing of infinitives is due to
 an attempt to speak of them in terms that apply to certain parts of
 speech. Sometimes this seems forced. For instance, in the sentence,
 “He seemed to tremble,” pupils are told to consider the infinitive
 as a predicate adjective, when it does not seem to them to bear much
 resemblance to an adjective.

 What the pupils must see is this,--that _to tremble_ completes _seem_
 and tells something about the subject _he_. The following sentences
 may be given,--“He seems a coward,” “He seems afraid,” “He seems to
 tremble.” The verb in each case has a subjective complement, but
 in one case this complement is a noun, in another an adjective, in
 another an infinitive, the choice depending wholly on the special
 meaning to be brought out. If the use of _to tremble_ seems to the
 pupil sufficiently like that of _afraid_ to warrant his calling it
 a predicate adjective, let him do so. If not, let him not try to
 name it, but say of it instead that it completes the verb and tells
 something about the subject.

The infinitive complement of a passive verb belongs here; for example,
“The human voice may be made _to attain a wondrous strength and
richness of tone_.”--_Brook._ This construction often arises from
changing a sentence containing a double object into the passive form.
In the active voice the sentence just quoted reads,--“We may make the
human voice attain a wondrous strength, etc.” Notice that the passive
construction has the advantage over the active in this respect, that it
enables us to avoid telling _who_ makes. This is especially convenient
with the verb _say_. In the sentence, “He was said to have stolen the
money,” no one is charged with having said that he stole.

 NOTE.--The familiar expressions, “That is to say,” “It came to pass,”
 “I came to know him,” also belong here; _came_ is used in the sense of
 _became_.

3. As an adverbial modifier of the verb. The infinitive is very often
joined to a verb to denote purpose; as, “The salmon winters in the
ocean, but in spring ascends the fresh water rivers _to spawn_, or
_lay its eggs_.” Sometimes this infinitive is introduced by _so as_ or
_in order_. It has almost entirely displaced the adverbial clause of
purpose.

The infinitive may also denote the result of an action; as, “His
half worn shoes would wait until his small brother grew _to fit
them_.”--_Holmes._

In the following sentence from Barrie, “Leeby returned panting _to say
that the doctor might be expected in an hour_,” the infinitive seems
to be employed instead of another finite verb, for the meaning is not
that Leeby returned in order to say, but rather that Leeby returned
_and_ said. In the sentence, He went home _only to die_, the infinitive
denotes neither the purpose nor the result of his going home, but only
a subsequent action. It might be preferable in such cases to call the
infinitive an accompaniment of the verb rather than a modifier.

In this sentence from Holmes, “I grieve _to say it_, but our people, I
think, have not generally agreeable voices,” _to say it_ denotes the
cause of my grieving.

In this sentence from Henry James, “He must have been an American, _to
take the picturesque so prodigiously to heart_,” the infinitive phrase
is the equivalent of an adverbial clause of reason, telling on what
ground the main assertion rests.

The infinitive may also denote condition, or manner; for example, “You
must have the imagination of a poet _to transfigure them_,” and, “Is
everything going _to suit you_?” In the former sentence the infinitive
phrase is equivalent to the clause, _if you transfigure them_. In
the latter it tells _how_ things are going on. In fact, this useful
little element may accompany a predicate verb to denote almost all the
relations denoted by adverbial clauses.

Sometimes it is difficult to decide whether an infinitive is a
complement or a modifier. Perhaps the best way to settle the point is
to ascertain what the infinitive is equivalent to, or what question
it answers; for example, “If you continue your observations, you will
not fail to notice that the speed of its disappearance depends on the
character of the day.”--_Tyndall._ Here the infinitive answers the
question, _fail in what respect?_ and is equivalent to the phrase, _in
noticing_. It is well, then, to consider it an adverbial modifier.

Perhaps the infinitive is used after no other verbs oftener than after
_go_ and _use_, as in the sentences, “I am going to stay until you
are tired of me”; “I used to wonder what this might be.” Both _go_
and _use_ are intransitive verbs, but the infinitives can hardly be
described as their modifiers, for the predication lies more in the
infinitive than in the finite verbs, _am going_ or _used_. The verb
_am going_ makes the action denoted by the infinitive intentional, and
_used_ makes it customary. Such predicates as _am going to stay_ and
_used to wonder_ should be described either as idiomatic verb-phrases,
or as consisting of an intransitive verb and an infinitive, without any
attempt to establish a complementary or modifying relation between the
infinitive and the verb.

 NOTE.--The verb _be_ is sometimes used in the sense of _go_ or _come_,
 and may then be modified by an infinitive of purpose, as in the
 sentence,--“The old Master was talking about a concert he had been to
 hear.”--_Holmes._

III. The infinitive may be associated with an adjective or an adverb.

A construction often met is a predicate adjective followed by an
infinitive, especially such adjectives as _sure_, _glad_, _sorry_,
_apt_, _anxious_. The infinitives answer such questions as _sure of
what?_ _anxious about what?_ and so limit the meaning of the adjective;
for example, “We are right willing and able to work.”--_Carlyle._ “He
was careful to acquaint himself with the country.”

Often the adjective is first modified by the adverb _enough_ or _too_;
thus, “This narrative is too significant to be omitted.”--_Carlyle._

When the adjective is first modified by _so_, the infinitive is
introduced by _as_, and takes the place of a clause of result; as,
“Be so kind _as to stand_.” Here the infinitive is brought into the
sentence by the adjective _kind_, but as an infinitive of result, may
be said to modify the entire predicate _be so kind_.

The infinitive in this construction may also be associated with
an adverb; as, “He worked so swiftly as to surprise us all.” We
notice that it is easy to avoid the clause here by substituting the
infinitive, for the subject of the clause is the same as the subject of
the principal verb.

An adjective in the comparative degree is often followed, not by a
clause of degree as we should expect, but by an infinitive introduced
by _than_; as, “He is wiser than to make such a remark.” The infinitive
phrase modifies _wiser_ and is joined to it by the subordinating
conjunction _than_.

IV. In addition to the foregoing constructions we occasionally find the
infinitive used as the object of a preposition. The few prepositions
governing infinitives are _except_, _but_, and _save_, the two latter
meaning _except_; as, “Make no expense but to do good to others or
yourself.” Usually, _to_, the sign of the infinitive, is omitted after
these prepositions.

In the following sentences the preposition governing an infinitive
phrase is omitted.--“It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who
gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are
men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end _what to do with the
money_.”--_Conan Doyle_. “I am somewhat at a loss _what to think_.”
The prepositional phrases _at their wits’ end_ and _at a loss_ are
complements of the verbs _are_ and _am_, used instead of adjectives
because there are no equivalent adjectives. The infinitive phrases
answer the questions _at their wits’ end about what?_ and _at a loss
about what?_ and so are best disposed of as objects of the preposition
_about_ understood.

 NOTE.--In the construction, “I am about to go,” _about_ is usually
 disposed of as a preposition governing the infinitive. Instead it
 should be considered as an adverb modifying the infinitive, which is
 the complement of _am_.

The preposition _for_ may take a double object; thus, “A space was
left between them for _the garrison to pass out_.” The answer to
the question _for what?_ is, _the garrison to pass out_. Such a
prepositional phrase is often used as logical subject after the
anticipative subject _it_; thus, “It is not lawful for us to put any
man to death.”

 NOTE.--In the common construction, “I cannot but think,” the word
 _think_ is an infinitive with _to_ omitted, used as object of the
 preposition _but_. There is an ellipsis in this construction which
 must be supplied for analysis, unless we dispose of the whole
 expression at once as an idiomatic verb-phrase. Supplying the ellipsis
 we have, “I cannot do anything but think.”

 The expression, “I can but think” is best disposed of now as
 equivalent to “I can only think,” for that is what it signifies to us.
 The verb then is _can think_, and _but_ is its adverbial modifier.

V. The infinitive may be used independently, having no grammatical
relation to any other word in the sentence; thus, “_To tell you the
truth_, my errand is not so much to buy as to borrow.”--_George Eliot_.
Certain stereotyped phrases are used in this way, such as _to be sure_,
_to speak plainly_, _to make a long story short_. They are useful to
express in few words what in other more regular constructions it would
take many words to say.

In this sentence of Hale’s, “This sort of vagueness, _not to say
misapprehension_, affects the question, Who are our Leaders?” we have
an independent infinitive phrase which adds much to the meaning of the
sentence. It tells us here that the author uses the noun _vagueness_ so
as to be on the safe side, but in his opinion _misapprehension_ is the
more precise term.

 NOTE.--An independent expression very similar to the one just given
 is found in the following sentence,--“It appeals to our more purely
 human, _one might almost say domestic_, qualities.”--_Lowell._

CHAPTER XXI

THE PARTICIPIAL PHRASE


The participle has been defined by grammarians as a verbal adjective.
They do not mean that it limits or qualifies the meaning of a noun as
an adjective does. Very few participles do that. They mean only that it
is brought into the sentence for the purpose of telling something about
some noun. It is not usually so close a modifier of the noun, either
in relation or position, as many other noun adjuncts are; often it is
so loosely joined to its noun as to seem almost like a parenthetical
element. When the noun it modifies is the subject of the sentence, then
the great importance of the participle as a sentence-element lies in
the fact that it is a convenient means of avoiding a predication.

=Participial Forms.=--The participial forms of the transitive verb are
six.

  _Active_--Seeing, having seen.
  _Active progressive_--Having been seeing.
  _Passive_--Being seen, seen, having been seen.

The participles of the intransitive verb are four.

  _Common form_--Going, gone, having gone.
  _Progressive_--Having been going.

 NOTE.--We frequently meet these combinations of words: _being gone_,
 _having been gone_. They are not passive participles of the verb _go_,
 for they do not denote action received any more than do the phrases
 _being sick_ and _having been sick_. The word _gone_ is a participle
 used as an adjective complement of the participles _being_ and
 _having been_, just as the word _sick_ is used. This is a very common
 construction, seen in such familiar sentences as the following,--He
 _is risen_, the tree _is fallen_, the coat _is_ badly _worn_, you _are
 mistaken_, the meat _is done_. In all these instances the participles
 denote a condition of the subject, and are therefore complements of
 the verb.

The most common use of the simple participial forms, like _seeing_
and _seen_, is to help form progressive verb-phrases and passive
verb-phrases; thus, _is seeing_, _shall be seeing_, _might have been
seeing_; _is seen_, _shall be seen_, _might have been seen_. These
phrases are not to be separated into their constituent parts, however,
but are to be treated as single verbs, hence we are not concerned with
the participles they contain.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Uses of the Participle.=--1. The participial adjective.--The one use
of the participle which is almost identical with that of the adjective
is seen in such expressions as _running_ water, _trotting_ horse,
_educated_ man, _spoiled_ child. Here the idea Of action is not so
prominent as that of quality. Some of these participles have become so
far like adjectives as to admit of comparison; for example, _striking_
in such an expression as _striking appearance_, or _deceiving_ in
_deceiving story_. Some of them, too, may be modified by _very_, which
is never a verb modifier; as, _loving_ in _very loving children_.

This participle is sometimes used substantively; thus, “The _loving_
are the _daring_.” “The _slain_ were left to die.” Of course such
a word as _people_ is understood after these participles, and in
analyzing these sentences it may be supplied if one so desires, but
it is no more necessary than it is in the sentences,--“The _good_ are
happy, the _righteous_ are blessed,” where a qualifying adjective is
used as a noun.

2. The participial phrase as a substitute for a proposition.--We come
now to those frequent and important uses of the participle where
it saves a predication. It usually has other words associated with
it, either as complement or modifiers, the whole group forming a
participial phrase.

(_a_) The participial phrase may take the place of an adjective clause;
as, “The use of the cartridges _complained of_ was discontinued
by orders issued in January 1857.”--_McCarthy._ The participle is
here equivalent to a restrictive adjective clause pointing out the
particular cartridges.

Just as often the participial phrase is equivalent to an unrestrictive
clause, and then it is very much like an appositive modifier; as, “The
first person I met was a poor old woman, _a little bowed down with age,
gathering grapes into a large basket_.”--_Longfellow._

(_b_) The participial phrase may take the place of an adverbial
clause; as, “And, _having once tasted a life like this_, he could no
more return to what he had left behind him.”--_Boyesen._ Here the
participial phrase tells us _why_ he could no more return to what
he had left behind him. If this idea were differently expressed, we
should have either a prepositional phrase modifying the predicate or
an adverbial clause of cause introduced by _since_. But all this does
not make the phrase a grammatical adjunct of the predicate. Instead it
is an adjunct of the subject _he_. If it were expanded into a clause,
the subject _he_ would have to be supplied and the phrase would become
a predicate. Now, as predicate it would tell something about the
subject _he_; and it does not cease to do this when it is changed to a
participial phrase.

In the following sentence from Geikie,--“_Entering the polluted Temple
space, and gazing round on the tumult and manifold defilement_, He
could not remain impassive,” the phrase is plainly equivalent in
meaning to an adverbial clause, telling _when_ (and in some degree
_why_) he could not remain impassive. But grammatically the phrase is
an adjunct of the subject _He_.

Lest it should not be perfectly clear to the reader what particular
relation the participial phrase is intended to denote, the author
often indicates the relation by the same conjunction that he would
use to introduce an adverbial clause; as, “But we must above all
other things take into account, _when considering the position of
the Hindoo_ _Sepoy_, the influence of the tremendous institution of
caste.”--_McCarthy._ Without _when_ the reader’s first thought would be
that the phrase denotes cause.

In this sentence from Cooper,--“But the vessels of which we write,
_though constructed at so remote a period_, would have done credit to
the improvements of our own time,” the concessive phrase might have
been interpreted as causal, if _though_ had not been inserted.

In this sentence from Hamlin Garland,--“Each soul was solemn, _as if
facing the Maker of the world_,” the fact that the phrase denotes
manner is made evident by the conjunction _as if_. Any conjunction used
like _when_, _though_, _as if_ in the sentences quoted, may be said to
introduce the participial phrase and to indicate its relation.

 NOTE.--In all such sentences as the above, where the participial
 phrase is introduced by a subordinating conjunction, it is perfectly
 proper, before analyzing, to supply the words necessary to make the
 participial phrase into an adverbial clause. It is more satisfactory,
 indeed, to do this except in a few cases where such an expansion gives
 a verb that does not harmonize in tense or form of conjugation with
 the verb in the principal proposition; for example, “Though holding
 no office and steadily refusing an election to the Storthing, he has
 been the life and soul of the liberal party.”--_Boyesen._ Here the
 concord of tenses would call for _has held_ and _has refused_ in the
 concessive clause instead of the progressive verb-phrases _has been
 holding_ and _has been refusing_.

(_c_) The absolute phrase as a substitute for a _dependent_
proposition.--In all the preceding examples the substitution of a
participial phrase for a clause was made easy by the fact that the
subject of the clause was the same as the subject of the principal
proposition. When the subject is not the same, the clause is condensed
into what has been termed an _absolute phrase_; as, “Nature, _her
patience with him being ended_, leaves him desolate.”--_Carlyle._

The absolute phrase consists essentially of a substantive and a
participle, having to each other the logical relation of subject and
predicate. In the sentence quoted the phrase is equivalent to the
adverbial clause of cause, _because her patience with him is ended_.
The absolute phrase is usually said to be grammatically independent,
but it is so frequently used as to be a regular English construction
now, and as such may be said to modify the predicate of the principal
proposition.

Notice that it is not a _participial_ phrase that modifies the
predicate; it is an _absolute_ phrase. The participial phrase is only
one of the two equal parts of the absolute phrase; it can hardly be
said to modify the noun, which is the other part, but it stands side by
side with the noun to make an absolute phrase.

The absolute phrase denotes other relations than that of cause. The
most common are concession and time; as, “Was Oliver Cromwell, _his
bitterest enemies themselves being judges_, destitute of private
virtues?”--_Macaulay._ “_Night coming on_, they broke the bolts of the
Town gates.”--_Carlyle._

(_d_) The chief use of the absolute phrase is to take the place of
an independent proposition; thus, “A child of three sat up in his
crib and screamed at the top of his voice, _his fists clinched_ and
_his eyes full of terror_.”--_Kipling._ Here the absolute phrases
have no relation of time, cause, concession, etc., to the principal
proposition, hence are not modifiers. If expanded into propositions
these phrases would only add coördinate thoughts to the first
one--“_His fists were clinched_,” and “_his eyes_ _were full of
terror_.” It is best to call such phrases accompaniments of the
predicate instead of modifiers.

 NOTE.--From the sentence just quoted we learn that the absolute phrase
 does not always contain a participle; it may consist of a substantive
 and an adjective, as in _his eyes full of terror_. We also find
 absolute phrases in which a prepositional phrase takes the place of
 the participle; as, “He left my side, _a summer bloom on his fair
 cheeks_, a smile parting his innocent lips.”--_Miss Mitford._

 It is even possible to make an absolute phrase of two substantives as,
 “Hargreaves and Arkwright, _both Englishmen_, invented and improved
 spinning and weaving machinery.”

 It would be proper to supply the participle _being_ before either the
 adjective, the prepositional phrase, or the noun, but it is best to
 dispose of constructions just as we find them.

A construction parallel to the absolute phrase is found in the
sentence, “Half way up the hill he met Bagheera _with the morning dew
shining like moonstones on his coat_.”--_Kipling._ Here the object of
the preposition _with_ is the whole group of words following it, and
of this group the base-words are the noun _dew_ and the participle
_shining_, which have the logical relation of subject and predicate.
This is a very common construction after the prepositions _with_ and
_without_.

3. The participial phrase often takes the place not of a whole
proposition but only of a predicate; for example, “Westward on the
banks of the Thames, the towers of Westminster Abbey stand _guarding
the ashes of England’s greatest men_.” The meaning here is, the
towers stand _and_ guard; but by means of the participle one of these
predicates is subordinated to the other. The participial phrase is not
so much a complement of the verb _stand_ as an accompaniment of it; at
the same time it tells an attribute of the subject.

A construction seemingly like the one just given, but in reality
different, is found after verbs of _going_ or _coming_. These verbs may
be followed by participles which tell not an accompanying action, but
how the going or coming is accomplished; as, “Sometimes a wandering
leaf came _floating and wavering downward_, and settled on the
water.”--_Longfellow._ This does not mean that the leaf came _and_
floated _and_ wavered, but only that it floated and wavered, and these
actions were the means of its coming. Such a participle is truly a
modifier of the verb.

4. The participle as part of a double object.--After a few verbs like
_keep_, _find_, _see_, _hear_, _feel_, _have_, we find the participle
taking the place of the infinitive in a double object. The participle
is almost always chosen when a passive construction is needed; as, “The
saddle fell to earth, and he heard _it trampled_ under-foot by his
pursuer.”--_Irving._ When the active construction is called for, the
advantage of the participle over the infinitive is that it gives the
idea of longer continuance of the action; as, “Just then he heard _the
black steed panting_ and _blowing_ close behind him.”--_Irving._

The expression _kept me waiting_ is grammatically equivalent to _made
me wait_.

5. There are two constructions of the participle that are quite
different from any of those cited, being deviations from its ordinary
use.

(_a_) The participle used adverbially to denote degree; thus, _boiling_
hot, _stinging_ cold, _dripping_ wet. Here the participles unmistakably
modify adjectives.

(_b_) The participle used independently; thus, “_Speaking of those
yellow squash-bugs_, I think I disheartened them by covering the
plants so deep with soot and wood-ashes that they could not find
them.”--_Warner._ This participial phrase corresponds to the infinitive
phrase used independently, though it is more rarely met.

CHAPTER XXII

THE GERUND


The gerund, or infinitive in _-ing_, is substantive in its nature, for
like the root infinitive it _names_ the action or state asserted by
the verb. It is not so easily identified in the sentence as the root
infinitive, however, for in form it is precisely like the participle,
from which it has to be distinguished entirely by its use.

=The forms of the gerund= are shown in the following examples:--

1. The transitive verb _see_:

  Active--seeing, having seen.
  Active progressive--having been seeing.
  Passive--being seen, having been seen.

2. The intransitive verb _rise_:

  Common form--rising, having risen.
  Progressive form--having been rising.

=The use of the gerund= is almost entirely restricted to that of the
noun. When found without adjuncts it does not materially differ from
the noun; for example, _Painting_ is a fine art. But usually the
verb-nature of the gerund is prominent as well as its noun-use, for
usually it is accompanied by a complement or adverbial modifiers;
as, “The need of _feeling responsible all the livelong day_ has been
preached long enough in our New England.”--_Wm. James._ The gerund
together with its adjuncts forms a gerund-phrase. It has certain
advantages over the root infinitive. In many places it is preferable
because it gives the idea of an action in progress. It is also
employed in relation to some words where usage does not permit the
root infinitive. Furthermore, its substantive nature comes out more
prominently than that of the root infinitive, for like the noun it may
be modified by an article or a possessive; thus, “Pascal said that most
of the evils of life arose from _man’s being unable to sit still in a
room_.”--_Bagehot._

I. The gerund used as a noun.

1. Subject of a verb; as, “_Lying in bed and listening to their dreary
music_ had a pleasure in it.”--_Holmes._

2. Object of a verb; as, “I remember _being told that it was the sound
of the waves_.”--_Holmes._

3. Objective complement; as, “If a child finds itself in want of
anything it runs in and asks its father for it--does it call that
_doing its father a service_?”--_Ruskin._ Here the gerund phrase helps
to complete the verb _does call_ and at the same time is an attribute
of the direct object _that_.

4. Subjective complement; as, “The first of all English games is
_making money_.”--_Ruskin._

5. Appositive modifier; as, “I recommend this most faithful form of
reading--_learning by heart_.”

6. Object of a preposition; as, “Nelson attributed all his success in
life to _having been a quarter of an hour before his time_.” This is
the commonest use of the gerund, for while the root infinitive may be
used after very few prepositions, the gerund may be used after many.

7. Objective adverbial.--The adjective _worth_ is usually followed by a
noun that expresses a measure of value, answering the question _worth
how much?_ or _worth what?_ It may be followed by a gerund answering
the same question; as, “That is worth _paying for_.”--_Warner._

II. The gerund used adjectively.--We find the gerund used
adjectively in such expressions as _sleeping_-car, _mourning_-robes,
_dining_-table, _eating_-apples. These gerunds seem at first like the
participles in such expressions as _singing_-bird, _shooting_-star,
_barking_-dog; but they are not like participles in meaning, as can
be proved by changing them to equivalent elements of other kinds. A
singing-bird is a bird _that sings_, but a sleeping-car is not a car
that sleeps; it is a car _for sleeping in_.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Peculiar Constructions.=--It cannot always be settled to one’s entire
satisfaction whether a certain element is a participle or a gerund.
In order to decide one must know just how a certain expression came
to be, that is, of what earlier and older form it is a development.
Sometimes it seems impossible to ascertain this. For instance, take the
sentence, “Nanny has been busy ironing this evening.”--_George Eliot._
Is _ironing_ a participle, and does the order of words in this sentence
arise from a transposition of the sentence,--“Nanny, ironing, has been
busy this evening”? Or is _ironing_ a gerund, and is this sentence a
parallel construction with, “Nanny has been busy _at her ironing_ this
evening”? Either interpretation of the sentence is a sensible one.

Another puzzling instance is found in the sentence,--“He was two weeks
learning to use his flippers.”--_Kipling._ Is _learning_ a part of the
progressive verb-phrase _was learning_, and does the sentence mean, “He
was learning to use his flippers during two weeks”? Or is _learning_
a gerund, object of _at_ understood, that is, is the sentence a
parallel construction with this,--“You were a long time _at it_”? One
cannot pronounce with certainty on this point, but must choose the
construction that seems to him most reasonable.

CHAPTER XXIII

THE PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE


=Function.=--No other sentence-element is more frequently employed
or more useful for the precise expression of thought than the
prepositional phrase. By its aid we can define exactly the scope of a
noun, a verb, or an adjective. This is due not to the great number of
prepositions in the English language, for there are not a hundred in
all, but to the many different relations that may be denoted by one
preposition. A striking illustration of this is found in the following
sentence:

“One of the useful and grateful tasks of historians and biographers is
to bring forward to the eye of every new generation of men and women
those illustrious characters who made a great figure in the days of
their grandfathers and grandmothers, yet who have nearly faded out of
sight in the rush of new events and interests, and the rise of new
stars in the intellectual firmament.”--_Lord._

Here we find the preposition _of_ used eight times and expressing
almost as many different relations. The first of-phrase, _of the useful
and grateful tasks of historians and biographers_, serves to point out
the whole group or class of things from which the one thing talked
about is selected. The second phrase, _of historians and biographers_,
limits _tasks_ by telling who performed these tasks. The third phrase
_of every new generation of men and women_, limits _eyes_ by telling
whose eyes are meant. The fourth phrase, _of men and women_, limits the
application of the noun _generation_ to human beings only, and brings
in the nouns _men_ and _women_ to serve as antecedents of the pronoun
_their_ later in the sentence. The fifth phrase, _of their grandfathers
and grandmothers_, specifies what days by locating them in the past.
The sixth phrase _out of sight_, has the preposition _of_ reinforced
by _out_ so that the two words are equivalent to _from_, and thus the
phrase denotes not only place but movement away from it. The seventh
phrase, _of new events and interests_, and the eighth, _of new stars_,
are alike in function; they tell what things _rush_ and _rise_.

Every one of these phrases except _out of sight_ modifies a noun;
but just as often a phrase introduced by _of_ modifies a verb or an
adjective. As soon as we hear the adjectives _capable_, _full_, _glad_,
_jealous_, _proud_, _rid_, _sure_, _weary_, do we not expect an answer
to the question, _capable of what? full of what? glad of what?_ etc.
And do we not usually find such verbs as _borrow_, _buy_, _complain_,
_cure_, _make_, _smell_, _speak_, _taste_, _tell_, _think_, _warn_,
followed by an of-phrase?

What is true of the extensive use of _of_ is no less true of other
prepositions,--_at_, _by_, _from_, _in_, _on_, _to_, _with_; while
there are some whose use is much more limited,--_across_, _after_,
_before_, _up_, _toward_.

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Prepositional Phrase used Adjectively.=--We say of prepositional
phrases that they are adjective or adverbial, according to what they
modify--nouns, verbs, or adjectives. We have seen from the sentence
quoted how freely the prepositional phrase may be joined to a noun,
and how many different relations it may express. Let us see now what
sentence-elements this adjective prepositional phrase takes the place
of.

In the following sentence from Geikie,--“The stay of Jesus in Capernaum
at this time was very short,” the phrase _of Jesus_ takes the place of
the possessive noun _Jesus’s_. It is better than the possessive here,
not so much because this particular possessive is an awkward form as
because _stay_ is the more important word and should have the prominent
place at the beginning of the sentence.

In Higginson’s sentence,--“Yet he has found readers at all periods
alike among men of thought and men of action,” the phrases _of
thought_ and _of action_ take the place of the adjectives _thinking_
and _active_. But the adjectives, preceding their nouns, seem less
important than the nouns; while the phrases, coming after the nouns,
imply that the contrasted words _thought_ and _action_ contain the more
important ideas.

In Boyesen’s sentence,--“According to Norwegian law at that time, every
son of a king was entitled to his share of the kingdom,” the phrase
_at that time_ is a substitute for the clause, _which was operative at
that time_; but it is preferable, not only for brevity, but because it
makes the modifier less prominent,--it is not forced upon the reader’s
attention as it would be by a subject and predicate.

We may well repeat here what was said in one of our first chapters,
that several different elements may be exact equivalents before they
are in a sentence, but as soon as we desire to make use of one of them
for the communication of thought, they are not equivalent--one of them
will almost invariably serve our turn better than the other. _Thinking_
men, men _of thought_, men _who think_ are identical in meaning, but in
a sentence the special setting of these expressions, the accompanying
ideas, will determine which most clearly and precisely conveys our
meaning and should therefore be used.

Besides modifying a noun, the adjective prepositional phrase
may complete an intransitive verb; as, “My march was _of long
duration_.”--_Audubon._ “All these writers are _of a revolutionary
cast_.”--_De Quincey._ “All the floors in Venice are _of
stone_.”--_Howells._ In sentences like these the phrase denotes an
attribute of the subject. It is usually employed because there is no
adjective that expresses so well the precise meaning.

The adjective _long_, if used in the first sentence quoted, would
imply that the march was long in space, in miles traversed, but the
phrase means only that it consumed much time.

The adjective _revolutionary_, if used in the second sentence, might be
interpreted to mean that the writers belong to a revolutionary period,
or that they are decidedly in favor of revolution; but the phrase means
only that they have a leaning toward revolutionary ideas.

In the third sentence the noun _stone_ used adjectively would be to the
general reader an exact equivalent of the phrase _of stone_.

 NOTE.--Occasionally we find a prepositional phrase completing a verb
 and seeming more like a noun complement than an adjective; as, “A
 common means of transportation was _in clumsy carts drawn by oxen
 going at the most but three or four miles an hour_.”--_Draper._

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Prepositional Phrase used Adverbially.=--The prepositional phrase
often modifies a verb or an adjective, and may modify an adverb. As a
verb modifier it may denote the various relations denoted by clauses,
though place, time, and manner are the most common; as, “They come in
the summer months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold
gray sea.”--_Kipling._ Here we have three phrases modifying _come_,
introduced by _in_, _by_, and _out of_, and denoting respectively time,
manner, and place.

The prepositional phrase of place tells,--(_a_) where an action occurs
or a condition exists; as, “Herring appear in immense schools _off the
coast of Norway and the northern shores of the British Isles_”; (_b_)
whence an action proceeds; (_c_) whither an action tends. Both of these
last we find in the sentence,--

  “_From underneath an aged oak,
  That slanted from an islet rock_,
  A little skiff shot _to the bay_.”--_Scott._

The prepositional phrase of time may denote almost all the relations
denoted by the adverbial clause of time, and several of the words used
as conjunctions to introduce those clauses, such as _after_, _before_,
_since_, _till_, were originally prepositions and are still employed as
such.

The prepositional phrase of manner is found quite as often as the
adverb of manner; for example, “He had fired with great rapidity yet
with surprising accuracy.” If adverbs had been used here the sentence
would read, “He had fired very rapidly yet surprisingly accurately.”
The combination of the last two adverbs is exceedingly awkward.

When a prepositional phrase modifies an adjective it generally serves
to limit its application by denoting the particular respect in which
its meaning is to be considered; thus, “Our fathers emerged from their
arduous, protracted, desolating Revolutionary struggle, rich indeed _in
hope_, but poor _in worldly goods_.”--_Greeley._ Here the phrases tell
in what particular our fathers were _rich_ and _poor_.

 NOTE.--The prepositional phrase may modify the interjection _alas_,
 which is equivalent to the assertion _I am sorry_; thus, “One may
 believe that the golden age is behind us or before us, but alas for
 the forlorn wisdom of him who rejects it altogether.”--_Higginson._

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Prepositional Phrase used Substantively.=--We often find a
prepositional phrase used as the object of a preposition. This gives
rise to a succession of two prepositions like _from among_, _from
beneath_, _until within_, _till_ _after_. Some grammarians treat these
as one compound preposition, but it seems to us best to consider them
separately.

In the following sentence from Bolles,--“The river came from between
abrupt, rocky walls,” the phrase _between abrupt, rocky walls_ denotes
a place that no noun in the language names, hence the phrase is
employed to name the place, and as such a name it is the object of the
preposition _from_.

It is very common for the preposition _except_ or _but_ (meaning
_except_) to be followed by a prepositional phrase used as its object;
thus, “Nobody comes to Novastoshnah except on business.”--_Kipling._
“No great art ever yet rose on earth but among a nation of
soldiers.”--_Ruskin._ A phrase of this sort is usually preceded by some
negative expression, and is necessary to the truth of the sentence,
as it brings in a reservation or exception to some sweeping negative
statement.

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Prepositional Phrase in an Absolute Phrase.=--The prepositional
phrase, as we saw in Chapter XXI., is sometimes used with a noun to
form an absolute phrase. It is not then an ordinary adjective modifier
of the noun, but is more like a predicated attribute, the verb being
omitted. It may be called an appositive modifier of the noun; for
example,

  “’Tis written that the serving angels stand
  Beside God’s throne, _ten myriads on each hand_.”--_E. Arnold._

The participle is omitted from the absolute phrase in such a sentence
because it can readily be supplied by the reader from the verb in the
predicate. It is always mentally supplied for the interpretation of
the sentence, but it need not be supplied for its analysis.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Object of a Preposition.=--The word or group of words that is brought
into relation to some other word by a preposition is called the object
of the preposition. It is always a substantive, but not always a noun
or pronoun. Some of the common substitutes for the noun are the gerund,
the prepositional phrase, and the noun clause. The prepositional phrase
in this use we have just discussed. The gerund and the noun clause were
discussed in Chapters XXII. and VII. respectively.

All of the above are regular constructions, but there are a few
peculiar stereotyped phrases in the language, made up of a preposition
and an adjective or adverb; as, _from far_, _at all_, _at once_, _at
the best_. It is wiser in such a case not to separate the phrase into
any component parts, but to think of it and treat it as if it were one
word.

Sometimes a preposition is associated with a verb or verbal in such
a way as not to require an object. Such a construction is usually
passive or infinitive; for example, “I was going to say something
about our boarders the other day, when I got _run away with_ by my
local reminiscences.”--_Holmes._ “Those who are still in a state to
require _being taken care of_ by others must be protected against
their own actions as well as against external injury.”--_Mill._ “One
child in a household of grown people _is_ usually _made very much
of_, and in a quiet way I _was a good deal taken notice of_ by Mrs.
Bretton.”--_Brontë._

Prepositions so used may sometimes be considered as adverbs, as in the
expressions, _money to do with, firesides to sit at_; but oftener it
is impossible to separate them from the verb-phrase or verbal-phrase of
which they form a part. They help to express the one notion denoted by
a whole group of words and have not the function of any part of speech.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Peculiar Prepositions.=--Some words originally participles have a use
so much resembling that of prepositions that they are no longer thought
of as verbals, but have come to be considered prepositions. Some of
these are _regarding_, _concerning_, _during_, _excepting_; as, “Our
judgments concerning the worth of things, big or little, depend on the
feelings the things arouse in us.”--_Wm. James._

Some combinations of words, like _as to_, _out of_, _instead of_,
_according to_, _owing to_, are now regarded as single prepositions.
They express a single relation, and often one word may be substituted
for them; as, “You drive a gambler out of the gambling room who loads
dice.”--_Ruskin._ “The Prince of Orange had not been consulted as to
the formation of the league.”--_Motley._

       *       *       *       *       *

=Is “Like” a Preposition?=--It is not uncommon to find both verbs and
nouns taking as an adjunct a phrase introduced by _like_; for example,

“That hand was cold, a frozen thing,--it dropped from his _like
lead_.”--_Mrs. Hemans._

“Now and then he would see a thin fin, _like a big shark’s fin_,
drifting along close to shore.”--_Kipling._

In such a phrase there is always a substantive, and if this is changed
to a personal pronoun we find that it is in the objective case; for
example, “A writer is so like a lover.”--_Holmes._ Substituting a
pronoun for _lover_ we find that usage calls for the objective form
_him_. Does this prove that _like_ is a preposition and _him_ its
object?

There is authority in dictionaries and grammars for calling _like_ a
preposition, and this is certainly both simple and convenient; but
sometimes it leads us into difficulties. In the sentence,--“He walks
more like a soldier than a priest,” shall we say that the preposition
_like_ is compared? In the sentence,--“It is very like a whale,” shall
we say that the preposition _like_ is modified by the adverb _very_,
a word that we expect to modify only adjectives and adverbs? In the
sentence,--“Like to an angel of peace she seemed that day,” how shall
we dispose of _to_ if we call _like_ a preposition governing _angel_?

If we go back to the writings of Milton and Shakespeare, we find
the words _liker_ and _likest_, showing plainly that in their time
_like_ was looked upon as an adjective or adverb. We often find, too,
the preposition _to_ or _unto_ expressed after _like_. It is best,
therefore, to dispose of _like_ as an adjective, meaning _similar_,
when it introduces a phrase modifying a noun or completing a verb;
and as an adverb, when the phrase modifies a verb. It will then be
necessary to supply the preposition _to_ or _unto_.

Words whose use much resembles that of _like_ are _near_ and its
comparative and superlative forms, _nearer_, _nearest_ and _next_; as,
“Near the foot of the walls there are magnificent groves of live oaks
and pines.”--_Muir._

In this sentence we consider _near_ an adverb, modified by a phrase
introduced by _to_ understood. Indeed, the preposition is very often
expressed; for example, “It was next _to_ impossible for a peasant or
artisan or even a merchant to pass that line.”--_Lord._

A construction similar to this is found in the sentence, “To be the
supreme authority in anything is a satisfaction to self-love next
door to the precious delusions of dementia.”--_Holmes._ Here _next
door_ takes the place of _next_. It should be treated as one adjective
element modifying _satisfaction_ and itself modified by the adverbial
propositional phrase following it.

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Prepositional Phrase modified.=--We sometimes find a prepositional
phrase accompanied by an adverb or by a noun used adverbially, as a
sort of measure; thus, “Before his father and mother died, they had
built, some way from their palace, a very beautiful temple.”--_Old
Deccan Days._ In this sentence the verb _built_ is modified by the
phrase _some way from their palace_, the base of this being the
prepositional phrase _from their palace_; this phrase is modified by
_some way_, a noun element used adverbially to answer the question _how
far from their palace?_

In this sentence from John Lord,--“Why did no great scholars arise,
even in the church?” the adverb _even_ modifying the phrase _in the
church_ has a very important office. Its presence in the sentence
entirely changes the meaning. Without _even_, the sentence would tell
us that no great scholars arose in one place, the church; but with
_even_ the sentence tells us that no great scholars arose anywhere, and
that it was very strange that they did not arise in the church, where
we should naturally expect to find them.

Two prepositional phrases joined by _and_ are often each modified by
the adverb _partly_, or even by the pronoun _what_ used adverbially.
_What_ may also modify one prepositional phrase; thus, “What with
teaching others and studying closely myself, I had hardly a spare
moment.”

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Preposition modified.=--So many prepositions were originally
adverbs or may be used as adverbs, that it is not strange to find
them taking adverbial modifiers. Hence we frequently meet such
a succession of words as _ever since_, _just outside_, _right
over_; as, “A horticulturist of eminence wanted me to sow lines of
strawberries and raspberries right over where I had put my potatoes in
drills.”--_Warner._

       *       *       *       *       *

=Position of the Preposition.=--The word _preposition_, meaning _placed
before_, implies that this part of speech precedes its object, but this
it not always the case. It is not uncommon in poetry to find the phrase
inverted; for example,

  “Pleasant it was when woods were green,
      And winds were soft and low,
    To lie amid some sylvan scene,
  Where, _the long drooping boughs between_,
  Shadows dark and sunlight sheen
      Alternate come and go.”--_Longfellow._

We find the transposition, too, in the familiar expressions _the year
round_, _the night through_, _the world over_; as, “The evergreens can
keep a secret the year round, some one has said.”--_Burroughs._

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Prepositional Phrase as an Abridgment of a Proposition.=--In the
chapter on the adverbial clause of degree we found that the clause
as expressed frequently consists only of the conjunction and a
prepositional phrase; as, “The force of the wind had never been greater
_than at this moment_.” We cannot give a satisfactory analysis of such
a sentence without supplying after _than_ the subject _it_ and the verb
_was_. It is best also to supply where a clause of manner has been
abridged; as, “The scene changed _as at a theatre_.”

But there are sentences in which propositions have been abridged to
prepositional phrases and no ellipsis can be supplied; for example, “In
manner he was quiet and gentlemanlike, _with the natural courtesy of
high breeding_.”--_Froude._ In this sentence the phrase is equivalent
to an independent proposition joined to the first proposition by
the conjunction _and_,--“_and he had the natural courtesy of high
breeding_.” Such a phrase may be described as an accompaniment of the
predicate rather than a modifier of any word in it.

CHAPTER XXIV

THE APPOSITIVE PHRASE


=Function.=--As a means of avoiding a predication, perhaps no other
sentence-element is oftener employed than the appositive phrase; as,
“They have the genius for hard work--_the most desirable kind of
genius_.” The appositive is a very loosely joined adjunct, but its
position in the sentence and the frequency of its use make its relation
easily intelligible.

The appositive phrase comes about in this way. The sentence quoted
above really amounts to two independent propositions; namely, They have
the genius for hard work, and, The genius for hard work is the most
desirable kind of genius. These propositions joined into a closely
built sentence with proper subordination might read thus,--They have
the genius for hard work, which is the most desirable kind of genius.
Here we have an unrestrictive adjective clause.

The important part of this clause, the only part that adds anything
new to the sentence, is the complement, _the most desirable kind of
genius_. The subject _which_ merely represents a previous word, and the
verb _is_ is only a link between the subject and its attribute, the
complement. These two words help in the grammatical structure of the
proposition, but since they are easily supplied by a reader, they may
just as well be omitted, as in fact is often the case. This brings the
really important words into a position next to what they explain or
describe, but without any relation-words between them. A group of words
so used is called an appositive phrase. The base-word of the phrase,
usually a noun, is called a noun in apposition.

In general the appositive is not a necessary element of the sentence.
So far as the truth of the statement and the grammatical structure of
the sentence are concerned, it may be omitted. Sometimes, however, it
is joined to a noun to point out a special individual or class, when it
resembles the restrictive adjective clause; as, “It is quite true that
practical life is a kind of long, competitive examination, conducted by
that severe pedagogue, Professor Circumstance.”--_Huxley._

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Base-Word of an Appositive Phrase.=--When the base-word of an
appositive phrase is a noun, it gives another name for something,
and so makes that thing more fully known by revealing another of
its attributes; as, “We turn to commemorate the genius and virtues
of John Milton, the poet, the statesman, the philosopher, the glory
of English literature, the champion and the martyr of English
liberty.”--_Macaulay._

Attributes are just as often told by adjectives as by nouns, hence we
find many appositive adjectives; as,

“At the first glimpse he thought it a dog--_long, lean, skulking,
prowling, tawny_--on the scent of his tracks.”--_J. L. Allen._ The
adjectives are an abridgment of an unrestrictive adjective clause, just
as appositive nouns are.

Besides the noun and the adjective, the base-word of an appositive
phrase may be,--

(_a_) A reflexive pronoun; as, “The old Professor _himself_ sometimes
visited the house after it had changed hands.”--_Holmes._ This pronoun
does not explain or describe in the least. It is put into the sentence
for emphasis.

(_b_) A personal pronoun. This forms a convenient word to add a phrase
or clause to; as,

  “How good it was of him
      To mind a slender man like me,
  _He of the mighty limb_.”--_Holmes._

(_c_) A pronominal adjective. This does not explain. It has not
sufficient meaning in itself for that. Like the personal pronoun it
is to be modified by some phrase or other sentence-element that has
meaning; as, “On a gently rising ground in the heart of the city
rises St. Paul’s, _one_ of the largest churches in the world, and a
masterpiece of Wren, _one_ of the greatest architects.” In neither
place here does _one_ mean anything until it is modified by the phrase
telling class.

Such an appositive may serve many purposes. In the following sentence
from Lowell, “The poetry of the Danes was _much of it_ authentic
history,” it narrows the scope of what it modifies,--_the poetry of the
Danes_.

(_d_) The infinitive. See Chapter XX.

(_e_) The gerund. See Chapter XXII.

(_f_) The participle. When a participial phrase is clearly an
abridgment of an unrestrictive adjective clause, it may be said to be
in apposition; as,

  “All are architects of Fate,
  _Working in these walls of Time_.”--_Longfellow._

(_g_) The noun clause. See Chapter VII.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Words that take an Appositive Modifier.=--The appositive is usually
added to a noun, but not always. A pronoun may be made definite in
its application by an appositive; thus, “_We_ are doing the English
cathedral towns, _Aunt Celia and I_.”--_Mrs. Wiggin._

 NOTE.--In the following sentence from Wordsworth,--

  “But oh, ye fountains, meadows, hills, and groves,
  Forebode not any severing of our loves,”

 many would consider the nouns in the first line as appositives of
 _ye_. It seems better to consider _ye_ as filling the office of a
 limiting adjective. If we spoke _about_ the fountains, we would say
 _these fountains_; speaking _to_ them it is usage to employ the
 pronoun _ye_ in the place of _these_.

Occasionally we find an adjective, adverb, phrase, or clause, explained
by some sort of appositive; as, “Active and sprightly people are
called _mercurial_, that is, _born under the planet Mercury_.” Here a
participial phrase is in apposition with the adjective _mercurial_.

The appositive may even be used to explain a predicate, a use in
which it very much resembles one use of the adjective clause; as,
“The surplus beyond what was required for the support of the national
worship was distributed in alms among the poor; _a duty strenuously
prescribed by their moral code_.”--_Prescott._

       *       *       *       *       *

=Introductory Word.=--The appositive is frequently introduced or
brought into the sentence by such words or expressions as _namely_,
_to wit_, _as_, _that is_, _or, in other words_; as, “The whale is a
mammal, _that is_, a warm-blooded, air-breathing animal that suckles
its young.”

The introductory _as_ is useful in limiting the application of a noun,
signifying that it is to be considered only to the extent denoted by
the appositive; as, “To the Esquimaux, the auk, _as an article of
food_, is second in importance only to the seal.”

With this restrictive office _as_ often introduces an appositive to
a possessive pronoun; as, “As _masters your_ first object must be to
increase your power.”--_Ruskin._ It will readily be seen that _masters_
is an appositive of _your_ if the sentence is changed thus, “The first
object of you, as masters, must be, etc.”

_Such as_ or _as_ often brings in the names of several individuals
belonging to a certain class; thus, “The leaves and tender twigs are an
agreeable food to many domestic animals, _as_ the cow, horse, sheep,
and goat.”--_Thoreau._

A noun whose meaning is broad may have two appositives, specific in
meaning, joined by _or_ and introduced by _whether_; as, “There is
always something to see about a church, _whether living worshipers or
dead men’s tombs_.”--_Stevenson._

       *       *       *       *       *

=Case and Number of the Noun in Apposition.=--The appositive noun is
usually in the same case as the noun it explains, but often when it
is joined to a possessive noun, the possessive case ending is dropped
from the first noun for the sake of euphony, and added only to the
appositive.

In number an appositive usually agrees with its noun, but not always;
for example, “The _priests_ were _each_ devoted to the service of some
particular deity.”

       *       *       *       *       *

=Position of the Appositive Phrase.=--Usually the appositive follows
immediately the group of words it explains; but sometimes the two are
separated by intervening words; thus, “_These votive pictures_ are no
less interesting _as works of art_ than as expressions of hopeless
superstition.”--_Howells._

Sometimes the appositive begins a sentence; as,

  “_One burnished sheet of living gold_,
  Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled.”--_Scott._

“_Calm, strong, and nobly aglow with love of country_, he has no need
of going into paroxysms in order to prove his sincerity.”--_Boyesen._

CHAPTER XXV

THE DIRECT OBJECT


The direct object of a transitive verb is so familiar a
sentence-element that it makes itself understood without much special
investigation. It presents few peculiarities, and these are not
difficult.

The transitive verb is usually defined as one that denotes action
terminating on an object. This definition does not cover all verbs
called transitive, for instance, the verb _have_, meaning _own_, which
does not denote any action whatever. But it would be difficult indeed
to make a better definition. The definition, a transitive verb is one
that takes an object, is open to the objection that it applies only to
transitive verbs in the active voice, whereas passive verbs are also
transitive in meaning. We may say this much, however,--(_a_) no verb
is considered transitive unless it has two substantives, a subject
and a complement, the two meaning different things, an agent and a
non-agent. (_b_) A sentence containing a transitive verb can always be
changed to the passive form, the complement becoming the subject, and
the subject of the active verb becoming the object of the preposition
_by_. This second point is a better test of the transitive verb than
the definition is.

For example, take the verb _earn_ in the sentence,--“Indeed, a man may
earn twenty thousand dollars a year by writing ‘sensation-stories,’ and
have nothing to do with literature in any high sense.”--_Higginson._ It
is true that when a man earns he acts, but his action is not performed
upon the twenty thousand dollars. In so far this verb does not come
under the definition of a transitive verb; but it answers the test,
that is, it may be changed to the passive; thus, “Twenty thousand
dollars was earned by him.” This does not mean that the twenty thousand
dollars received an action; it means that twenty thousand became his
possession as a result of his work.

Of transitive verbs denoting action performed directly upon some
object, examples are in the following sentences.

(_a_) “Let us _build_ altars to the Beautiful Necessity, which secures
that all is made of one piece.”--_Emerson._

(_b_) “When Gabriel _blows_ his trumpet I hope he will select the
moment before sunrise for his summons.”--_Bolles._

(_c_) “Many men _eat_ finer cookery, _drink_ dearer liquors, with what
advantage they can report and their doctors can.”--_Carlyle._

Examples of transitive verbs like _earn_ that take an object and denote
action, but not action really performed upon the object, are found in
the following sentences.

(_a_) These deluded people _visit_ fortune tellers in the hope of
_finding out_ what is to happen in the future.

(_b_) “He _entered_ the street at the end opposite to the Holborn
entrance.”--_George Eliot._

(_c_) “As he approached the village, he _met_ a number of
people.”--_Irving._

Action always suggests to us at first thought physical action, that
accompanied by movement; but there are other kinds of action which may
be told by transitive verbs.

1. Action of the mind, denoted by such verbs as _believe_, _learn_,
_think_, _remember_; as, “_To know_ anything that turns up is, in the
infinity of knowledge, _to know_ nothing.”--_F. Harrison._

2. Action of the emotions, denoted by such verbs as _hate_, _love_,
_revere_; as, “When Père Antoine was a very young man, he had a friend
whom he _loved_ as he _loved_ his life.”

3. Action of the senses, denoted by the verbs _see_, _hear_,
_feel_, _smell_, _taste_; as, “_To see_ a good man and _hear_ his
voice once a week would be reason enough for building churches and
pulpits.”--_Holmes._

Verbs of saying, like _tell_, _remark_, _declare_, _exclaim_, are
followed by a direct object, usually a quotation or a noun clause
telling just what was said; thus, “He _cried_ in the bitterness of his
soul that God had hid his face from him.”--_Macaulay._

The verbs _ask_ and _teach_ are often followed by two direct objects,
one of the person and the other of the thing; as, “Whoever will teach
the people of New England the advantages of good food, fresh air, and
sunshine, will renew the physical constitution of the race.”--_J.
F. Clarke._ “Ask a great money-maker what he means to do with his
money--he never knows.”--_Ruskin._

These verbs are really used in a double sense. For instance, in the
first sentence, in so far as _will teach_ takes the object _the people
of New England_, it means _instruct_; in so far as it takes the object
_the advantages of good food, fresh air and sunshine_, it means
_impart_. When such a sentence is changed to the passive form, either
object may become the subject, and the other may remain as the object
of the passive verb; or, if the personal object remains, it may be
called an indirect object.

Some verbs usually intransitive may become transitive by being followed
by a cognate object, that is, one whose meaning is akin to that of the
verb, as in the familiar expressions _run a race_, _dream a dream_,
_smile a smile_; as, “There he fell into evil paths, and on a fatal day
_sinned a great sin_.”--_Hillis._

Some transitive verbs may be followed by an object meaning the same
person or thing as the subject. This is called a reflexive object; as,
“On the wall opposite, about a mile across the gulf, _a brook was
pouring itself_ to the valley.”--_King._ In this sentence the brook is
conceived in two aspects, that of a doer and that of a receiver--it
pours and is poured.

Some verbs are made transitive by the addition of an adverb; as,

  “Ring out the old, ring in the new,
  Ring out the false, ring in the true.”--_Tennyson._

Here _the old_ is the object not of the verb _ring_, but of the verb
_ring out_.

Frequently a preposition is to be taken with a verb, the two
words denoting one idea and that transitive; as, “You cannot stir
abroad but Jews and Christians _pounce upon_ you with unsettled
bonds.”--_Carlyle._ A test for this sort of compound verb is that
when it is changed to the passive form, the two words--verb and
preposition--remain together; thus, “You are pounced upon by Jews and
Christians.”

In the sentence, “Make up your mind to forego driving sledge,” we
have four different direct objects. (1) The compound verb _make up_
takes the object _your mind_. (2) The whole group of words _make up
your mind_ is equivalent to the one verb _decide_, and as such takes
the infinitive phrase for object, _to forego driving sledge_. (3) The
object of the infinitive _to forego_ is the gerund-phrase _driving
sledge_. (4) The object of the gerund _driving_ is the noun _sledge_.

A combination of two verbs with the meaning of one transitive verb is
found in the every-day expression _make believe_, meaning _pretend_.
This cannot be separated. It is usually followed by an infinitive or
a noun clause used as its object. For example, “Whereupon the puppy
jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,
and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it.”--_Lewis Carroll._

CHAPTER XXVI

THE SUBJECTIVE COMPLEMENT


=Function.=--When we wish to assert that a thing possesses a certain
quality, we do it by a predicate made up of some form of the verb _be_
together with an adjective; as in the sentence, “The very name was
uncanny.”--_Page._ Here the idea words are the subject noun and the
adjective in the predicate; the verb _was_ serves merely as a copula,
or tie-word, necessary for the grammatical structure of the sentence,
but having little, if any, meaning.

The verb is employed in the same way when we wish to denote--

(_a_) The identity of two ideas; as, “The secret of success is
concentration.”--_Schreiner._

(_b_) The class to which a thing belongs; as, “Ben Battle was a soldier
bold.”--_Hood._

In such sentences as the three quoted, we call the adjective or noun in
the predicate a _subjective complement_ of the verb. The noun is often
termed a predicate nominative, and the adjective a predicate adjective.
In either case the complement tells some attribute of the subject,
and it is for the express purpose of telling this attribute that such
sentences are made. These sentences are very common, being framed
to answer certain questions that it is natural for the mind to ask;
namely, who is he? what is it? what kind of person is he? what sort of
thing is it?

The noun used as base-word of a subjective complement does not
necessarily agree with the subject in number; as, “Justice and
Reverence are the everlasting central Law of the Universe.”--_Carlyle._

Neither does the subjective complement have to succeed its verb.
Sometimes the whole order of the sentence is inverted; thus, “Fair as
a summer dream was Margaret.”--_Lowell._ “A very attractive person is
that child-loving girl.”--_Miss Mitford._

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Subjective Complement not always a Noun or Adjective.=--Often,
as was stated in Chapter XXIII, a prepositional phrase takes the
place of a predicate adjective, usually because we have no adjective
adequate to express the meaning of the phrase. In this sentence from
Lowell,--“Popular literature is _of value_,” the adjective _valuable_
might well be substituted for the phrase; but in the following
sentences the language affords no equivalent adjectives.--“I am _in
love_ with this green earth.”--_Lamb._ “J. G. Whittier is _of a Quaker
family_ and was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts.”

The noun clause, the root infinitive, the gerund, and the participle
used as subjective complements, have been discussed in preceding
chapters.

To this use must also be referred the personal pronoun in the
possessive case used as in the sentence,--“All the beauty of these
summer days is _mine_.” Is this pronoun a predicate nominative meaning
_my beauty_, or is it a predicate adjective meaning _possessed by me_,
or shall we make no attempt to classify it at all?

The word _so_ often does duty as a subjective complement. It is used to
avoid a repetition of some noun or adjective; as, “The house is empty
and has been _so_ for months.”

       *       *       *       *       *

=Verbs that take a Subjective Complement.=--The verb _be_ is by no
means the only one that may be completed by a subjective complement.
There are numerous others, most of which will fall in the following
classes.

1. _Become_, and verbs of similar meaning, like _grow_, _get_, _turn_;
as, “Bob had grown up very handsome.”--_Page._

2. Certain verbs of position like _stand_, _sit_, _lie_; as, “The moon
stood bright and full in the heavens.”--_Howells._

3. Verbs signifying to appear to the senses, like _look_, _feel_,
_smell_, _sound_, _taste_; as, “Our own thought sounds new and larger
from his mouth.”--_Emerson._ “Both he and his wife looked outwardly
gentlefolks.”--_Lamb._

4. A few verbs denoting action, like _begin_, _come_, _go_,
_rise_, _spring_; as, “One that goes in a nurse may come out an
angel.”--_Holmes._ With this class of verbs an adjective complement
often seems to partake of the nature of an adverb; as, “They descended
_fearless_ into all gulfs and bedlams.”--_Carlyle._ The author must
decide whether to use the adjective or the adverb by his purpose. That
is, does he wish to make more prominent the condition of the subject or
the manner of the action?

5. Certain passive verbs. In general these are:--

(_a_) Verbs of _calling_; as, “The place is fitly called Inspiration
Point.”--_King._

(_b_) Verbs of _deeming_; as, “I have been counted a successful
teacher.”--_Annie Preston._

(_c_) Verbs of _making_; as, “The forlorn condition of the new settlers
was made still worse by domestic feuds.”--_Prescott._

       *       *       *       *       *

=Introductory Word.=--After some verbs it is usage to precede the
complement by _as_ or _for_, sometimes even by the infinitive _to
be_. These words are not connectives, nor do they add anything to the
meaning of the sentence, though often they do serve to make it more
clear; thus, “Chaucer undoubtedly began as an imitator, perhaps as mere
translator.”--_Lowell._

If _as_ were omitted, it might not be clear at once that _imitator_ is
not a direct object of _began_.

CHAPTER XXVII

THE OBJECTIVE COMPLEMENT


=Function.=--Sometimes an action performed upon an object makes a
different thing of that object. Our desire to tell this as briefly as
possible has given rise to sentences in which a transitive verb is
followed by two complements, one a direct object naming the thing
acted upon, and the other an attribute of the direct object telling the
outcome of the activity denoted by the verb; as, “By his Sketch Book
Irving has made the Hudson a classic river.”

The second complement is quite as often an adjective as a noun; for
example,

  “Shafts of sunshine from the west
    Paint the dusky windows red.”--_Longfellow._

We understand from this sentence that the windows undergo the action
denoted by the words _paint red_, and are therefore changed from dusky
windows to red windows.

Such a word as _river_ in the first sentence or _red_ in the second is
called an objective complement. A noun used in this office somewhat
resembles an appositive, being a second name for an object already
named; but the appositive has no relation to any word except the noun
it explains, while the objective complement has a very important
relation to the predicate verb. So close is this relation that we
may often express the meaning of the two words, the verb and the
objective complement, by one word; as, “Political freedom makes every
man an individual.”--_Higginson._ Here the verb _makes_ and the
objective complement _an individual_ may be combined into the one verb
_individualizes_.

The close complementary relation of the objective complement to
the predicate verb is still further brought out when a sentence of
this type is changed to the passive form. There arises the sentence
discussed in section 5 in the preceding chapter, a sentence wherein the
direct object of the active verb has become the subject of the passive
verb, and the objective complement still remains after the verb but
becomes a subjective complement.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Verbs that take an Objective Complement=:--

(_a_) Verbs of _making_, such as _render_, _elect_, _appoint_, called
factitive verbs; as, “Old habits of work, old habits of hope, made my
endless leisure irksome to me.”

(_b_) Verbs of _thinking_, such as _consider_, _regard_, _look upon_;
as, “The student is to read history actively and not passively, to
esteem his own life the text, and books the commentary.”--_Emerson._

(_c_) Verbs of _naming_ or _calling_; as, “We do not hesitate
to pronounce them a brave, a wise, an honest, and a useful
body.”--_Macaulay._

(_d_) The verbs _feel_, _find_, _leave_, _prove_, _see_; as, “He
had never seen her so radiant, so young.”--_J. L. Allen._ “Chaucer,
like Dante, found his native tongue a dialect and left it a
language.”--_Lowell._

(_e_) Some intransitive verbs are completed in this way, especially
when the direct object is a reflexive personal pronoun; as, “They
shouted themselves hoarse.” “She cried herself sick.” These sentences
mean--“They made themselves hoarse by shouting”; “she made herself sick
by crying.”

       *       *       *       *       *

=Introductory Word.=--After some verbs usage puts in the word _as_
or _for_ before the objective complement, using it merely as an
introductory word; thus, “I respected him as a sound and accurate
scholar.”--_De Quincey._

  “No harmless thing that breathed,
  Footed or winged, but knew him for a friend.”--_Aldrich._

When these sentences are changed to the passive, the introductory word
is usually retained before the subjective complement.

 NOTE.--After _as_ the participle may take the place of an adjective;
 as, “I consider him as having lost his right.” The participle has here
 the same use that the adjective _destitute_ has in the expression
 _destitute of his right_.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Position of the Objective Complement.=--It usually follows the
direct object, but the adjective so used is sometimes placed next
to the verb, and the noun may, to render it emphatic, be placed at
the beginning of the sentence; as, “Grape shot will sweep clear all
streets.”--_Carlyle._ “A perpetual fountain of good sense Dryden calls
Chaucer.”--_Lowell._

We have certain stereotyped verb-phrases such as _make free_, _think
best_, and _see fit_, in which the adjective is so closely related to
the verb that it is placed next to it, and the two words have acquired
the meaning of one verb. _Make free_ has almost the meaning of _dare_;
for the other two phrases there are no good substitutes. These phrases
are followed by an infinitive phrase used as direct object. For
example,--“A native of that region saw fit to build his house very near
it.”--_Holmes._

CHAPTER XXVIII

THE INDIRECT OBJECT


=Function.=--Many verbs are followed by two substantives, both of
which are called objects; for example, “Abbot Samson read his monks
a severe lecture.”--_Carlyle._ “I will tell you a common case.”--_De
Quincey._ “For this did God send her a great reward.”--_De Quincey._ If
we ask the questions _read what?_ _will tell what?_ _did send what?_
the answers are the direct objects of the verbs, namely, _a severe
lecture_, _a common case_, _a great reward_.

If we go farther and ask the questions, read a severe lecture _to
whom?_ will tell a common case _to whom?_ did send a great reward _to
whom?_ the answers are--_to his monks_, _to you_, _to her_. But in the
sentences as quoted the preposition to is not expressed, the meaning
being evident without it. A word used like _monks_, _you_, _her_, is
called the indirect object of the verb. It is not a complement, for the
meaning of the verb is complete without it; but it is brought into the
sentence by the verb, and is therefore its adjunct.

The indirect object is usually defined as denoting the one to whom or
for whom something is done. It is not always, however, a personal word,
as is seen in Shakespeare’s sentence,--“Give _thy thoughts_ no tongue
nor _any unproportioned thought_ his act.”

       *       *       *       *       *

=Position of the Indirect Object.=--The position of the indirect object
is next to the verb. If its position is changed, the preposition is
expressed, as is seen in the sentences,--“Mother made _me_ a dress,”
and “Mother made a dress _for me_.” The logical use of the word
_me_ is identical in the two sentences, but the sentences are built
differently. It prevents confusion if we call _me_ in the second
sentence the object of the preposition _for_, the phrase _for me_ being
an adjunct of the verb just as the one word _me_ is an adjunct of the
verb in the first sentence.

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Indirect Object in a Passive Sentence.=--When sentences containing
direct and indirect objects are changed to the passive form, the direct
object should become the subject, and the indirect object should remain
after the verb or should become the object of an expressed preposition.
If we change the sentence, “Abbot Samson read his monks a severe
lecture,” we should have, “A severe lecture was read to his monks by
Abbot Samson.” But it is a common practice to make the indirect object
the subject of the passive verb and leave the direct object unchanged;
thus, “The monks were read a severe lecture by Abbot Samson.” In this
sentence _lecture_ is called a residual object of the passive verb
_were read_.

Sentences arising in this way are often extremely awkward, and should
not be tolerated; for example, “I was sold a horse.”

       *       *       *       *       *

=Verbs that take an Indirect Object.=--The most common are bring,
build, cost, cut, do, fling, forgive, get, give, grant, hand, leave,
make, offer, pay, play, pledge, promise, reach, read, sell, send, show,
teach, tell, throw, weigh, win, wish, yield.

Since the indirect object is not a necessary sentence-element, it
follows that it is frequently omitted, so that we find these verbs
taking only the direct object. On the other hand, we occasionally find
verbs followed by an indirect object and no direct object. This comes
about in several ways.--

(_a_) When the sentence is changed to the passive form and the
preposition _to_ or _for_ is not supplied; as, “This chance was never
offered _me_ before.”--_James Thomson._

(_b_) When the direct object is omitted, being unimportant or else well
known; as, “After he had earned the reward the committee refused to pay
him.”

(_c_) When the verb is intransitive; as, “The effort cost him his
life.” The word _life_ is not a direct object but an answer to the
question _how much?_ therefore an adverbial noun.


Exercise 35

Dispose of all indirect objects in the following sentences. Account for
the sentences in the passive form.

 1. The constant sight of chilblains among people who bring you bread,
 cut you cheese, and weigh you out sugar, by no means reconciles the
 Northern stomach to their prevalence.--_Howells._

 2. Give a busy man ten minutes to write a letter, and he will dash it
 off at once.

 3.  Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
         As the swift seasons roll.--_Holmes._

 4. The boy believes there is a teacher who can sell him
 wisdom.--_Emerson._

 5. The amiable manners of the Indian girl had won her the regard of
 the wife of one of the caciques.--_Prescott._

 6. He was allowed abundance of food and liberty to walk in the
 courtyard of the tower.--_Shorthouse._

 7. I think the old fellow has hitherto had scant justice done him in
 the main.--_Lowell._

 8. But since he was denied speech, he scorned the inarticulate
 mouthings of the lower animals.--_Warner._

 9. Paul, seeing a servant in the yard, ordered the boy something to
 eat.--_R. H. Dana, Sr._

 10. In Venetian streets they give the fallen snow no rest--_Howells._

 11. There is the large wooden reel which the blear-eyed old Deacon
 sent the minister’s lady.--_Holmes._

 12. We are shown the power of our country growing and
 expanding.--_Froude._

 13. It costs a beautiful person no exertion to paint her image on our
 eyes, yet how splendid is that benefit.--_Emerson._




CHAPTER XXIX

THE ADVERBIAL NOUN


=Function.=--Questions like _how long?_ _how far?_ _when?_ _where?_
are often answered by adverbs, phrases, or clauses; but they may be
answered by nouns, as in the following sentences,--“_A while_ she
paused; no answer came.”--_Scott._ “We are transported _a hundred and
fifty years_ back.”--_Macaulay._ “_Every moment_ they came nearer.
_Next door_ lives a carpenter.”--_Miss Mitford._

It is clear that the italicized expressions are used adverbially,
modifying respectively the verb _paused_, the adverb _back_, the verb
_came_, and the verb _lives_.

The base-word of each of these expressions is a noun, called an
adverbial noun. It is immaterial to us what case this noun is in, but a
study of Old English teaches us that it is in the objective case, while
a further proof is that we frequently employ a preposition before it.

The adverbial noun usually denotes measure of some sort, of time,
distance, space, weight, value, etc.

       *       *       *       *       *

=What the Adverbial Noun modifies.=--1. A verb; as, “A man could have
found places where he could have jumped three thousand feet in one
descent to the valley.”--_King._

2. An adjective; as, “He was nearly a head taller than myself.”

The adjective _worth_ is always modified by an adverbial noun answering
the question _how much?_ and frequently by others answering various
other questions; as, “Wheat worth a dollar a bushel last week is
selling now for eighty cents.” Notice that the modifiers of _worth_
differ in closeness of relation; the closest is _dollar_, the next
_bushel_, and the next _week_. This is not determined by position.

3. An adverb; as, “The oldest sergeant present stepped a pace forward.”

4. A phrase; as, “Centuries before this the Chinese had printed books
by means of carved wooden blocks.”

5. A clause; as, “His room is hung round with cases of them, each
impaled on a pin driven through him something as they used to bury
suicides.”--_Holmes._

In such a sentence as, “He is forty years of age,” it is somewhat
difficult to determine whether _years_ modifies _of age_ or _of age_
modifies _years_. This arises perhaps from the fact that neither
_years_ nor _of age_ makes a good base for the complement of _is_. He
is not forty years, neither does the sentence mean that he is of age.
We must say that _is_ is completed by the expression _forty years of
age_, used adjectively and having the meaning of one word. If we wish
to go further and analyze this complement, we say that _of age_ is the
base, meaning _old_, and that this phrase is modified by the adverbial
noun _forty years_.

It is the same in the sentence, “We often read about precipices that
are thousands of feet in descent.”--_King._ The verb _are_ is completed
by the group of words, _thousands of feet in descent_, having the
meaning of _very high_. Of this group _in descent_ is the base modified
by the adverbial noun _thousands of feet_.

A common construction is found in the sentence, “About two weeks ago I
looked down from the Mariposa trail into the tremendous fissure of the
Sierras.” In analyzing the adverbial element _about two weeks ago_,
we find the base-word to be the adverb _ago_; this is modified by the
adverbial noun _about two weeks_, the base of which is _weeks_ modified
first by _two_ and then by _about_.

 NOTES.--1. Many prefer to consider _about_ a preposition, governing
 _weeks_, and _ago_ an adjective modifying _weeks_. But in the familiar
 expression _long ago_, _ago_ is said to be an adverb, and its use
 seems to us the same in the expression _two weeks ago_. It is a case
 where use rather than derivation should determine the part of speech.
 _About_ has the same relation to _two weeks_ that _almost_ would have
 in the same position.

 2. A further expression denoting degree, which may well be noticed
 here, is found in the sentences,--“John is good and strong”; “She
 sailed good and fast.” In the first sentence it is not the author’s
 intention to give two attributes of John; the sentence means that John
 is very strong. In analyzing the sentence it is best not to separate
 the group of words _good and strong_. In the following sentence from
 Stevenson,--“But I was rare and hungry,” the substitution of _rare_
 for _good_ makes the sentence mean,--“I was unusually hungry.”


Exercise 36

Dispose of all nouns used adverbially in these sentences.

 1. A few years later, Prof. S. F. B. Morse, an American, invented the
 electric telegraph.

 2. If you had been able to keep awake only a year or two longer,
 you would not have been so wholly surprised by our industrial
 system.--_Bellamy._

 3. He is the chieftain who looms a head above all his
 people.--_Boyesen._

 4. Judgment for an evil thing is many times delayed some day or
 two, some century or two, but it is sure as life, it is sure as
 death.--_Carlyle._

 5. The snow lay half an inch deep on the brown tiles.--_Howells._

 6. Dante died only seven years before Chaucer was born.--_Lowell._

 7. Soon his face was worth going far to see.--_J. L. Allen._

 8. The desolate and splintered walls of Horeb and Sinai are not a
 quarter so high.--_King._

 9. Some years ago I was traveling by railway, no matter whence or
 whither.--_Froude._

 10. He was exactly five feet six inches in height and six feet five
 inches in circumference.--_Irving._

 11. Only about three weeks since, there was a leader with this or a
 similar title.--_Ruskin._

 12. I arrived one winter morning about five o’clock, and was not so
 full of soul as I might have been in warmer weather.--_Howells._

 13. Some of you are, perhaps, more livingly aware than you were an
 hour ago of the depths of worth that lie around you, hid in alien
 lives.--_Wm. James._

 14. He did not know that he bore with him from school and college a
 character worth much fine gold, but was pleased to find his mess so
 kindly.--_Kipling._

 15. This was a bad beginning; so, half an hour after the gun was
 withdrawn, the Austrian colonel ordered an assault.




CHAPTER XXX

PECULIAR MODIFICATIONS


It is not uncommon to find words modified in what seems to us an
ungrammatical way; for example, an article modifying an adjective, as
in the phrase _all the same_, or an adverb modifying a noun, as in the
sentence, “We walked the whole distance, _exactly three miles_,” where
the adverb _exactly_ is a modifier of the noun phrase _three miles_.
Some of these modifications we shall now consider.

1. The article _the_ modifying an adjective.--We find this in many
phrases that have become current in literature no less than in
conversation; for example, _all the quicker_, _none the worse_, _quite
the contrary_, _at the best_. In some instances, as in the last
example given, we may say that the adjective has become a substantive
in meaning and hence may be modified by the article. In other cases a
noun may be supplied after the adjective, and the article may be said
to modify the noun. But in most cases the adjective is used in the
sense of an adjective, and it is impossible, too, to supply any noun
after it, so we must take the expression as we find it and say that the
article modifies an adjective, the construction being idiomatical.

Illustrations of this construction are found in the following
sentences:--

(_a_) “Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being
driven, but they went on playing _just the same_.”--_Kipling._

(_b_) “The negroes declared that under the old house were solid
rock chambers which had been built for dungeons, and had served for
purposes which were _none the less_ awful because they were vague and
indefinite.”

Many of these phrases contain a modifying adverb. In _just the same_,
the adverb _just_ modifies _the same_. In _all the more_ we have _all_
used adverbially to modify _the more_.

The base-word of these phrases is just as often an adverb as an
adjective, as in the sentences, “This news only made us walk _the
faster_”; “He did it _none the worse_ for the many interruptions.”

2. In such expressions as _a few books_, _a good many trees_, the
article _a_ may seem at first thought to modify a plural noun; but this
is not the case. The article modifies the pronominal adjectives _few_
and _many_, having the meaning of collective nouns, that is, meaning
individuals taken as a group instead of singly. This pronominal is
then modified by the prepositional phrase _of books_, _of trees_, with
the preposition _of_ understood. Usage alone settles for us when the
preposition is to be expressed. We say _a few of them_; but if we use a
noun in place of the pronoun _them_ we omit the preposition; as, _a few
pennies_. We say _a score of years_, and _a couple of years_, but we
omit the preposition after _dozen_, another word denoting number, and
say _a dozen years_. After the collective noun _crowd_ we express the
preposition; as, _a crowd of boys_; but if we say _a great many_ in
place of _crowd_, we omit the preposition, saying _a great many boys_.
For analysis, however, the preposition should always be supplied.

3. Adverbs sometimes modify nouns.--This comes about often by abridging
an adjective clause to an appositive phrase; for example, “John Adams
was born at Quincy, _then part_ of the ancient town of Braintree, on
the 19th day of October (O. S.) 1735.”--_Webster._ If we supply _which
was_ after the noun _Quincy_, we have an adjective clause, in which the
adverb _then_ modifies the whole predicate--a regular construction. But
in the sentence as originally written, the adverb modifies the noun
_part_.

We occasionally find nouns used in the place of these modifying
adverbs. We may say _thrice the amount_, wherein _amount_ is modified
by the adverb _thrice_, or we may substitute for _thrice_ the noun
phrase _three times_. We also find the noun _something_ used in the
place of the adverb _somewhat_, as in the sentence,--“He had something
the manner of a Southerner.” Such a word restricts the application of
the noun it modifies. The adverbs _almost_ and _about_ are used in the
same way, as in _almost a year_, _about a pound_.

_But_ is frequently used adjectively in the sense of _only_, having a
limiting or restrictive force; thus, “He was but one generation removed
from the soil.”--_Boyesen._

Examples of adverbs modifying nouns are found in the following
sentences:

(_a_) “The Scheld, _almost exclusively a Belgian river_, after leaving
its fountains in Picardy, flows through the pleasant provinces of
Flanders and Hainault.”--_Motley._

(_b_) “It may well be doubted whether Roman literature,
_always a half-hardy exotic_, could ripen the seeds of living
reproduction.”--_Lowell._

(_c_) “South Dome is a vast globe of bold rock, _almost a full mile_ in
height.”--_King._

(_d_) “I fell a helpless prey to a boatman who addressed me in some
words of wonderful English and then rowed me to the sea wall at about
_thrice the usual fare_.”--_Howells._

4. Some nouns like _howl_, _cry_, _shock_, derived from verbs denoting
action, may be modified by an adverbial clause of time or place. We
may say, “He cried out joyfully when he caught sight of me,” where the
clause modifies the predicate _cried out joyfully_; or we may say, “His
cry when he caught sight of me was joyful,” where the same clause with
the same meaning modifies the subject _his cry_.

A clause introduced by _as_, with the meaning and construction of an
adverbial clause of manner, may modify a noun and so save several
words; for example, “Their plays are much shorter than the standard
drama _as it is known to us_.”--_Howells._ Here _as_ is equivalent to
the group of words _in the form in which_.

5. There are some modifiers of verbs consisting of several words which
should not be separated, inasmuch as they express only one idea. Some
of these are _by and by_, _off hand_, _day by day_, _side by side_.
Some of these expressions after they have been considered as units may
be separated into their compound elements. In the sentence, “They have
infested the place time out of mind,” we say that the predicate _have
infested the place_ is modified by the adverbial phrase _time out of
mind_, this having the force of one adverb. We may then say that this
phrase is made up of the noun _time_ modified by the prepositional
phrase _out of mind_.

6. Certain absolute phrases have become equivalent to single words
and as such are used adjectively or adverbially to modify nouns or
verbs. Some of these are _wrong side out_, _upside down_, _one behind
the other_. Each of these consists of a substantive--_wrong side_,
_upside_, _one_,--and an attribute of this substantive--_out_, _down_,
and _behind the other_. These attributes are joined directly to the
substantive because of the omission of the participle _being_. Examples
of these phrases are found in the following sentences:

(_a_) “Apoplexy is only egotism _wrong side out_.”--_Holmes._

(_b_) “Salvationists sat _three in a seat_ and played
concertinas.”--_Bolles._

CHAPTER XXXI

INDEPENDENT ELEMENTS


In the chapters on the infinitive phrase and the participial phrase,
we discussed those phrases used independently, that is, thrown loosely
into the sentence and forming no part of its structure, as in the
following sentences,--“It will then, _to borrow the elegant language
of the play-bills_, be withdrawn to make room for the forthcoming
novelties.”--_Macaulay._ “There is no custom that can, _properly
speaking_, be final.”--_Carlyle._

Besides phrases of these kinds, there are several other varieties of
independent elements that are commonly used and form very interesting
material in the sentence. Their function is often an important one,
and they could not be dispensed with without necessitating a very
roundabout and clumsy form of expression. Some of these elements
are single words, some are phrases, and some are propositions, both
independent in structure and dependent.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Words used Independently.=--I. The noun of address.--This is used in
two ways:

(_a_) In oral or written conversation or formal address, where the
name of the person spoken is used, either to invite his attention or
for the sake of courtesy; as, “Upon my life, _Mr. Caudle_, that’s very
cool.”--_Jerrold._

(_b_) In more or less impassioned composition, often poetry or oratory,
where the person or thing spoken about is addressed as if actually
present and capable of understanding the address. Such an address has
the nature of an explanation. It forms the figure of speech called
apostrophe; as,--

  “_O star of strength._ I see thee stand
  And smile upon my pain.”--_Longfellow._

2. We also have the noun used independently by pleonasm, that is,
either for emphasis or to call the reader’s attention to the subject
that is to be talked about; as, “_The birds that come about one’s
door in winter or that build in his trees in summer_, what a peculiar
interest they have.”--_Burroughs._ The base of this independent element
is the noun _birds_; the element is long because of the two restrictive
adjective clauses modifying _birds_.

Often this independent noun is introduced by _as for_ or _as to_;
_thus_, “_As for the boy_, he turned up after a while as a constant
guest.”--_Howells._ The words _as for_ indicate that the boy had
already been the subject of discourse in some previous sentence.

3. The words _well_, _now_, _why_ often begin a sentence. They may
indicate the writer’s state of mind, his attitude toward what he is
going to say, also the tone, whether of conviction, remonstrance,
surprise, or deliberation, with which the sentence should be read;
as, “_Why_, let him go home in the rain, to be sure.”--_Jerrold._
“_Now_, the capitalists were men of understanding and wise in their
generation.”--_Bellamy._

4. The interjection is an independent element. It may be a single word
or a group of words with the office of one. Such words and expressions
as _Ah!_ _Oh!_ _Alas!_ _Dear me!_ _O my stars and garters!_ _Hurrah!_
_fudge!_ _pooh!_ are used to communicate not our thoughts but our
feelings. In doing this they perform the work of a whole declarative
sentence; as,--

  “_Hurrah!_--_Hurrah!_--the west wind
      Comes freshening down the bay,
  The rising sails are filling,--
      Give way, my lads, give way!”

  --_Whittier._

The interjection _eh?_ is interrogative. _Whoa!_ and _hist!_ are
imperative. _O_ is frequently used before the noun of address.

       *       *       *       *       *

=The Prepositional Phrase used Independently.=--This is usually a
stereotyped phrase ready to hand for any one who wishes to use it, such
a phrase as _for example_, _in fact_, _in short_, _at any rate_. In the
following sentence from Stevenson, “I take it, _in short_, that I was
about as near Nirvana as would be convenient in practical life; and if
this be so I make the Buddhists my sincere compliments,” the little
independent phrase signifies to the reader that the author, instead of
going on with a long description of his state of feeling, has thought
of a happy way by which he can communicate a knowledge of it in very
few words.

In Irving’s sentence, “This, _by the way_, is a mere casual remark,
which I would not for the universe have it thought I apply to Governor
Van Twiller,” the independent phrase indicates that this sentence also
is only a casual remark, much like a personal “aside” from the author
to the reader.

In this sentence from Mrs. Gaskell,--“_In the first place_, Cranford
is in possession of the Amazons,” the phrase is equivalent to the
independent infinitive phrase _to begin with_. It informs the reader
that the remark it introduces is necessary as a setting or background
for further description of Cranford.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Propositions used Independently.=--1. The imperative sentence
addressed to the reader; as, “_Mind you_, this was the world as I
first knew it.”--_Holmes._ This independent element is like a note of
warning, telling the reader not to conclude that this is the world as
the writer knew it later.

2. An exclamation like “Bless your soul!” or “Thank God!” wherein
the subject of the verb is omitted. Such an expression reveals the
author’s feeling about the statement; as, “The civilized world is
learning, _thank God_, more and more of the importance of physical
science.”--_Kingsley._

An expression somewhat similar to this is found in the sentence,
“_Thanks to you_, I am able to speak French.” Here the cause of my
ability to speak French is given in the expression _Thanks to you_;
but this is not so constructed as to be a grammatical modifier of the
predicate, and hence must be considered independent.

3. A proposition introduced by _as_.--This has the structure of an
adverbial clause, but in meaning it is not a modifier of any part of
the sentence. Many of these expressions are stereotyped; for example,
_as it were_, _as it will be seen_, _as the case might be_, _as it was
called_. They are usually parenthetical. Their value in the sentence
can best be seen from a few examples.

(_a_) “Time, _as it will be seen afterward_, did not allow Sir George
Lewis any chance of making good this prediction.”--_McCarthy._ The
independent element here informs the reader that the author will not
drop the matter under discussion with the single statement of it, but
will take it up more at length later.

A similar expression, “as we have seen,” takes the reader’s mind back
to something he has read before.

(_b_) “The Saxon, _as it appears to me_, has never shown any capacity
for art.”--_Lowell._ The independent clause signifies here that the
author makes his statement not as a matter of fact but only as a matter
of personal opinion.

(_c_) “She was, _as I had supposed_, a gentlewoman whom a change of
circumstances had brought down from her high estate.”--_Holmes._ This
independent clause conveys to the reader the author’s satisfaction
in making a statement that is true and that coincides with his own
supposition.

(_d_) “‘You don’t know what your thoughts are going to be beforehand!’
said the ‘Member of the Haouse,’ _as he called himself_.”--_Holmes._
This independent element gives the authority for the preceding
quotation, and together with the quotation marks absolves the writer
from all responsibility for spelling and pronunciation.

Familiar forms of this clause are--_as everybody says_, _as the Bible
says_, _as Shakespeare puts it_. We often use the first of these when
we are unwilling ourselves to be held responsible for our statements.
The other two are sometimes used lest people should think we are trying
to pass off a quoted remark for an original one.

4. A clause of reason introduced by _for_. When such a clause is
independent, it gives the reason not for any action expressed in the
sentence nor for the whole statement, but rather the author’s reason
for using a particular word or phrase; as, “The bitterest opponent of
the poet (for like every strong personality he has many enemies) is
thus no less his debtor than his warmest admirer.”--_Boyesen._ Such a
clause is not always enclosed in a parenthesis; it is just as often
set off by commas or dashes.

5. An independent proposition, declarative.--Many of these independent
elements are stereotyped; such as, _I dare say_, _it seems_, _it is
said_, _it is true_. The following sentences contain familiar instances.

(_a_) “Mr. Swinburne, _Heaven knows_, has been imitated
enough.”--_Saintsbury._ The independent element here makes the sentence
emphatic, even makes it mean that Mr. Swinburne has been imitated too
much.

(_b_) “To equip so small a book with a preface is, _I am half afraid_,
to sin against proportion.”--_Stevenson._ The independent words are
here apologetic, revealing to the reader the author’s misgiving that
the preface is uncalled for, but not his full conviction.

(_c_) “I want my ‘asides,’ _you see_, to whisper loud to you who read
my notes.”--_Holmes._ The independent words, a familiar personal remark
to the reader, indicate the author’s appreciation of the fact that
the reader understands fully as well as the author the purpose of the
“asides.”

Sentences like the last three quoted could be re-arranged so that the
independent element would become the principal proposition and the rest
of the sentence a noun clause; thus, “Heaven knows that Mr. Swinburne
has been imitated enough.” This transposition is unjust, for it makes a
different sentence from what the author intended. Oftentimes sentences
read as if the independent element were not in the author’s mind when
he began to write, but occurred to him during the writing and so was
put in loosely, parenthetically--for a purpose, to be sure, but not as
part of the structure of the sentence. If we transpose such sentences,
we give the independent element an undue importance, not intended for
it by the author.

CHAPTER XXXII

SENTENCE MODIFIERS


Closely allied to the independent elements discussed in the preceding
chapter are certain adverbs and adverbial phrases, which seem to modify
not any special part of the sentence but the whole assertion. In some
cases it is difficult to decide whether it is better to call a certain
expression a sentence modifier or an independent element, but this need
not trouble us greatly, for it is not the name we give to an element
that is the vital point; it is a clear perception of what that element
does in the sentence for the communication of the author’s thought.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Classification of Sentence Modifiers.=--Certain of these modifiers are
so clearly distinguishable from all other sentence-elements that we may
study them in the following groups.

1. Adverbs.--Most of these are modal adverbs, denoting the manner
in which an assertion is made. This may be positive, doubtful, or
negative, hence the adverbs _surely_, _perhaps_, and _not_ are very
common sentence modifiers.

Other adverbs make the sentence emphatic, as _indeed_; others denote
the extent of its application, as _generally_; still others take the
reader back in thought to some previous statement, and denote the
logical relation between this previous statement and the sentence in
which they occur, as _moreover_, _however_, _anyhow_, _though_.

Examples of the use of these adverbs are found in the following
sentences:

(_a_) “_Perhaps_, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to
recommence your narrative.”--_Conan Doyle._

(_b_) “_Indeed_, almost all slang is like parched corn and should be
served up hot or else not at all.”--_Higginson._

(_c_) “It served, _moreover_, as a council of state to assist the
monarch in the transaction of public business.”--_Prescott._

2. Prepositional phrases.--These denote, for the most part, what the
modal adverbs denote. Usually they may be changed to adverbs that are
nearly or quite equivalent in meaning; for example, “on the other hand”
= _however_; “at all events” = _anyhow_; “of course” = _certainly_.

It may seem best to some persons to say of these phrases, as likewise
of the adverbs, that they modify the predicate instead of the whole
sentence. There can be no objection to this, as the predicate is the
asserting part of the sentence.

Examples of these phrases are found in the following sentences:

(_a_) “_For the most part_, young people have a pretty keen
sense of honor, so that the main thing is to keep it fresh and
active.”--_Munger._

(_b_) “_For my part_, I travel not to go anywhere, but to
go.”--_Stevenson._

(_c_) “_For the life of me_, I cannot understand it.”--_Stevenson._

3. Phrases or clauses introduced by _as_; for example,--

(_a_) “_As luck would have it_, there was a fair spring morning shining
over the city.”--_Black._ This clause means _luckily_, and tells the
author’s opinion of the statement he makes.

(_b_) “_As a rule_, we disbelieve all facts and theories for which we
have no use.”--_Wm. James._ This phrase means _generally_, and denotes
the extent to which the statement is true.

(_c_) “_As sure as my name is Jack Copley_, I saw the prettiest girl in
the world today.”--_Mrs. Wiggin._ This clause means _truly_, _verily_,
and is used to make the statement emphatic.

4. We frequently meet sentences containing a phrase like that
italicized in the following,--“_Far from showing due reverence to St.
Edmund_, he did not even show him common justice.”--_Carlyle._ This
phrase, it is plain, means “_instead of showing due reverence to St.
Edmund_,” but in addition it implies there is a very wide difference
between two things,--the thing he did not do and the thing he did do.
It would be natural for us to say--“Instead of white, she wore pink”;
and it would be just as natural to say--“Far from wearing white, she
wore black.” Our choice of phrases depends on the degree of difference
between the two things contrasted. The difference between white and
pink is not great; but the difference between white and black is one
hundred and eighty degrees.

When we analyze this sentence modifier we find it to consist of the
adverb _far_ for a base-word, modified by a prepositional phrase
introduced by _from_. The object of the preposition is a gerund, which
may be complete or incomplete, modified or unmodified.

It is not uncommon for _far_ to be modified by _so_, which only
intensifies its meaning; thus, “For the King’s subjects, _so far_ from
being charmed by his resolution to marry a woman out of their midst,
are scandalized.”

CHAPTER XXXIII

ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES


In preceding chapters we have spoken of the tendency in English speech
and composition towards abridgment. Independent propositions become
clauses, clauses become phrases, and phrases give place to words. This
tendency to abbreviate the expression of thought is due to two causes:
(1) a predominating interest in one’s ideas and a minor interest in
the expression. In such a case one uses only the significant words,
leaving out all those that can be supplied by the reader. (2) A desire
to be impressive, to gain and keep the reader’s attention. At such
times one rejects all unnecessary words as distracting attention from
the main purpose and retarding the progress of the main thought. The
result of either of these causes is an elliptical sentence--one that
cannot be analyzed without supplying certain elements necessary to its
grammatical structure.

Elliptical sentences are very common. Some of them have been already
mentioned in different chapters, for instance, the common idiom, “I
cannot but think.” Some other ellipses we shall make the subject of
inquiry in the present chapter, and for convenience we shall take them
up as ellipses in subordinate propositions and ellipses in principal
propositions.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Ellipses in Subordinate Propositions.=--

1. An elliptical adjective clause; as,--

  “A sound _as of myriads singing_
  From far and near stole in.”--_Whittier._

This ellipsis comes about through the omission of (1) the correlative
of _as_, which in this case is _such_, (2) the noun _sound_, which can
easily be supplied from the principal proposition, and (3) the verb
_is_. Expanded the sentence reads,--“Such a sound as a sound of myriads
singing is, from far and near stole in.”

2. The elliptical adverbial clause of time; as, “St. Patrick, _when a
boy of twelve_, lights a fire with icicles.”--_Froude._

In discussing adverbs as modifiers of nouns in Chapter XXX, we found
that an adjective clause is frequently abridged to an appositive
phrase in which the base-word, or noun in apposition, is modified by
an adverb. A sentence like the following might have arisen in such
a way,--“St. Patrick, _then a boy of twelve_, lighted a fire with
icicles.” Here we have an abridgment, but it is unnecessary to supply
any ellipsis, for we may say that the adverb _then_ modifies _boy of
twelve_. But in the sentence quoted we have not the simple adverb
_then_, but the subordinating connective _when_. In order that it may
perform its ordinary and proper function in the sentence, we supply
after it the two words _he is_, making a regular adverbial clause of
time, _when he is a boy of twelve_.

3. The elliptical clause of manner; as, “A great city sprang up _as
if by magic_.” This construction has been spoken of in the chapter
on prepositional phrases. It resembles the elliptical time clause in
that the connective _as if_ is a subordinating connective and needs
a complete proposition following it. In the sentence quoted we must
therefore supply the words _it sprang up_.

In the elliptical modal clause the connective is often the one
word _as_, though it generally has the meaning of _as if_; as, “On
that I found scratched _as with a nail or fork_, the following
inscription.”--_Holmes_.

4. The elliptical adverbial clause of condition.

(_a_) An omission of the connective and the subject; as, “This
frame of mind was the great exploit of our voyage, _take it all in
all_.”--_Stevenson._ Expanded for analysis this clause becomes, “_if we
take it all in all_.”

(_b_) An omission of the subject and the verb. This is found in
the familiar expression _if possible_, which is really _if it be
possible_, also in such sentences as the following,--“What is the use
of health and life _if not to do some work with them_?”--Here we may
supply after _if_ the words _the use is_ or _it is_.

5. The elliptical adverbial clause of concession.

(_a_) An omission of connective and subject; as, “_Do what we may_,
summer will have its flies.”--_Emerson._ In this sentence the verb _do_
is also to be supplied after the auxiliary _may_. Expanded the clause
reads, _though we do what we may do_.

(_b_) An omission of subject and verb, the latter being a copula; as,
“Solitude, _though silent as light_, is, like light, the mightiest
of agencies; for solitude is essential to man.”--_De Quincey._ Since
the noun _solitude_ immediately precedes the clause as subject of the
principal proposition, the clause is perfectly clear without even the
pronoun _it_ for a subject, and the verb _is_ is easily understood.
Only the new and necessary ideas need be expressed and these are the
attribute _silent as light_. The base of such an attribute is not
always an adjective; it may be a noun, a participle, or a prepositional
phrase.

(_c_) An omission of connective and subject, sometimes also of copula
or auxiliary, before a pair of words in opposition to each other and
joined by _or_; as, “_Rain or shine_, the King rode every day for
hours.”--_Thackeray._ This elliptical expression means “_though it
might rain or might shine_.”

6. The elliptical adverbial clause consisting of a connective and a
participial phrase. This may denote various relations,--time, manner,
condition, etc., but is so frequent a construction that it seems best
to treat it by itself. We have already spoken of this construction in
the chapter on participial phrases, where we gave illustrations which
might be disposed of without supplying any ellipsis. However, this
disposition is not always satisfactory, and some may prefer to expand
the clause in all cases of this kind. Illustrations are found in the
following sentences:--

(_a_) Denoting time,--“No amount of hereditary virtue has thus far
saved the merely devout communities from deteriorating, _when let
alone_, into comfort and good dinners.”--_Higginson._

(_b_) Denoting manner,--“It blew in enormous sighs, dying away at
regular intervals, _as if pausing to draw breath_.”--_Hearn._

(_c_) Denoting concession,--“Such men, _however pressed with business_,
are always found capable of doing a little more.”

7. The elliptical adverbial clause of degree.--This is so frequent that
we seldom find a clause of degree involving a comparison that is not
elliptical. We shall take up first the ellipses after the conjunction
_than_.

(_a_) An omission of the predicate when it is about the same as the
predicate of the principal proposition; as, “Alas! books cannot be more
than the men who write them (_are_).”

(_b_) An omission of both subject and verb when these are readily
supplied from the context; as, “In no other spot had sympathy been more
fiercely kindled than along that Western border where life was always
tense with martial passion.”--_J. L. Allen._ After _than_ we are to
understand the words _it had been kindled_.

(_c_) An omission of the subject. This may be the impersonal _it_;
as, “His features were more refined than (_it_) was usual in Roman
faces.”--_Froude._ Or the subject understood may be the indefinite
pronoun _what_; as, “We have a great deal more kindness than (_what_)
is ever spoken.”--_Emerson._

(_d_) Very much like the last type of sentence is one in which we
cannot supply _what_ but must supply _those who_, with the verb _are_
for the predicate of _those_; as, “He met more people _than could be
remembered_.” This clause expanded reads, “_than those are who can be
remembered_.” This gives us a restrictive adjective clause within the
clause of degree.

(_e_) We find cases of ellipsis after _than_ which it is difficult to
supply, and some of them are familiar everyday expressions current
everywhere and therefore invaluable in the communication of thought;
as, “Naturally the coming of the Marques de Valdeflores at this
critical juncture was regarded by the colonel as nothing less _than
providential_.”--_Janvier._ Shall we make a clause here reading _than a
providential thing is_?

Another difficult ellipsis is found in the sentence,--“He may look
up to a tower of rock and see its broken edges, softened by _more
than three-fourths of a mile_ of distance, directly above his
eyes.”--_King._ It seems best here not to attempt to supply anything,
but to take the italicized words as a unit, as if the one word _mile_
had been in their place. This sentence could, however, be expanded to
read--_softened by more of distance than three fourths of a mile is_.

Another common instance is found in the sentence,--“He was _more than
venerated_ in his day.”--_Lord._ This passive construction comes from
the active--“We _more than venerated_ him,” which in turn comes from
the sentence,--“We _did more than venerate_ him.” It is possible to
supply the ellipsis in the last sentence, making it,--“We did more
than to venerate him (_is much_),” but the other two sentences must be
considered idiomatic.

An idiom similar to the last is found in the sentence,--“In very marked
contrast with this younger man is the _something more than middle-aged_
Register of Deeds.”--_Holmes._ The italicized words are a group
signifying one idea, for which we have no single word. The base-word of
the group is _more_, but this alone is not a modifier of _Register of
Deeds_. So far as the group of words modifies the noun phrase _Register
of Deeds_, it cannot be separated.

       *       *       *       *       *

We come now to ellipses in clauses of degree after the conjunction _as_.

(_a_) The subject may be omitted; as, “These are by no means so nearly
connected _as might be thought at first sight_.”--_Bagehot._ Here we
may supply _it_ after _as_, or we may make the clause read “_as they
might be thought to be at first sight_.”

(_b_) The subject and auxiliary of the verb may be omitted when they
can easily be supplied from the principal proposition; as, “His
fellow-conspirators were hanged nearly as fast _as taken_.”--_Howells._
The clause expanded is “_as they were taken_.”

(_c_) As after _than_, so after _as_ we have some idiomatic expressions
arising by ellipsis which it seems best not to fill out; as, “He knew
that into the world where Ramona really lived he _did not so much as
enter_.”--_H. H._ This predicate may be expanded to read _did not do
so much as to enter is much_, but this is very awkward. Besides, _so_
_much as_ has to us an adverbial force, being almost equivalent to the
adverb _even_.

An extension of this construction is found in the following sentence
from Hawthorne,--“It was doubtful whether the poor lady _had so much
as closed_ her eyes during the brief night of midsummer.” The ellipsis
could be supplied if the predicate were _had done so much as close_,
but as it stands it must be considered an idiom and left as it is. This
construction has even gone over into the passive voice; as, “Parliament
_is not so much as mentioned_ in the whole instrument.”--_Webster._

Another familiar elliptical construction is found in the
sentence,--“But you think you _may as well have_ the right thing for
your money.”--_Ruskin._ If one wishes he may expand this sentence
so that it will read,--“you may have the right thing for your money
as well _as you may not have it_.” Here the entire clause is to
be supplied. Sometimes a portion of it is expressed, as in the
sentence,--“You may as well go _as not_.”

A peculiar expression denoting degree, which it seems best to give here
although it follows neither _than_ nor _as_ is found in the sentence,
He was _all but killed_. It seems best not to separate _all but_, but
to consider the expression as one adverbial modifier of the passive
verb _was killed_. In the sentence, He was _all but dead_, we may say
if we choose that _all_ is used as the base-word of the adjective
complement of _was_, and is modified by the prepositional phrase _but
dead_. However, the sentence does not appeal to us in this way; we do
not naturally make the separation between _all_ on one side and _but
dead_ on the other. Still less do we make such a separation when the
word following _but_ is a verb; as in, “We _all but_ _won_.” Instead
of this we keep the words _all but_ together as if they were one word,
having almost the same meaning as the adverb _nearly_.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Ellipses in Principal Propositions.=--1. The entire subject and part
of the predicate may be omitted; as, “A prick (= _I gave her a prick_)
and she passed the most inviting stable door.”--_Stevenson._ Here the
abbreviated expression accords well with the thought.

2. If part of a compound sentence is the same as what has already been
expressed, it is frequently omitted; as, “The former seems to have been
a loyal and homely soul; the latter (_seems to have been_) restless,
imperious, penetrating, unamiable.”--_Morley._

3. In replies to questions, that part is often omitted which can be
supplied from the question; as, “‘What do you hope?’ ‘That long before
this moon has grown old, you will be quite strong again.’”--_Miss
Mulock._ The reply is here a noun clause, object of _hope_, which with
its subject _I_ is to be supplied.

4. In sentences beginning with the words _no wonder_, the verb _is_ and
the anticipative subject _it_ are to be supplied. The real subject is
a noun clause following _no wonder_; as, “No wonder the princess loved
him.”--_Stockton._

5. The verb and the anticipative subject _it_ are often omitted at the
beginning of sentences introduced by _no matter_; as, “No matter just
at this moment, what he said.”--_Holmes._ Here the real subject of the
predicate _is no matter_ is the noun clause _what he said_.

6. Some interrogative or exclamative sentences begin with the words
_what if_. The word _what_ is all that is left of a principal
proposition, and _if_ introduces a conditional clause. It may seem best
sometimes to dispose of this if-clause as a noun clause used as the
real subject of the principal proposition. The principal proposition
may be expanded to read,--“_What does it matter_,” “_what matter is
it_,” “_what difference does it make_,” etc.; as, “What (_would the
result be_) if one of the Himalayas could be cloven from its topmost
tile of ice to its torrid base?”--_King._

7. A construction similar to the last is one in which the negative
adverb _not_ takes the place of a whole proposition; as, “Not that I
could see the boat drift, for I could not, the stars being all gone by
this time.”--_S. L. Clemens._ We may expand this sentence to read,--“_I
do not mean_ that I could see,” or “_I would not say_ that I could see.”

8. Exclamative sentences expressing a wish often begin with the verb
_would_, which is to be taken as equivalent to _wish_ with the subject
_I_ omitted. _Would_ is followed by a noun clause used as its object;
as, “Would to Heaven that we had a sieve, that we could so much as
fancy any kind of sieve that would do this work.”

9. The imperative _let_ is sometimes omitted at the beginning of a
sentence, especially before the verb _suffice_; as, “_Suffice_ it here
to say that the people in all times enjoyed a freedom far above that
possessed by any other city of Europe.”--_Besant._

ADVERTISEMENTS


GARNER’S GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES

By JAMES W. GARNER, Professor of Political Science, University of
Illinois

With Special State Editions


Merits the special consideration of teachers in secondary schools
because in the first place it includes the most recent governmental
problems of interest and importance, and in the second it devotes an
unusual amount of space to a practical account of the workings of our
government. The treatment, which is simple and interesting, proceeds
from the simple to the most complex, presenting in turn the local,
state, and national forms of government.

¶ The book shows how our governmental system has been affected by the
direct primary movements, the initiative and referendum, the commission
form of municipal government, and new legislation regarding publicity
of campaign expenditure and corrupt practices at elections. It is,
however, the spirit and actual workings of our government that are
emphasized, rather than its mere mechanism, thus adding to the interest
of the student as well as to the value of the study.

¶ The book is up to date in every respect. Statistics used are from the
latest census. It describes the most recent changes in the organization
and activities of the national, state, and municipal governments. For
example it deals with the recent reorganization of the federal courts,
the establishment of postal savings banks, the parcels post question,
the question of second class postal rates, primary elections, the new
federal corporation tax, and the income tax amendment.

¶ Unusual attention is devoted to the important subject of citizenship,
and to state and local governments. Wider reading among students is
encouraged by the frequent lists of references to collateral reading,
the documentary or source materials, the numerous search questions, etc.

OUTLINES OF ANCIENT HISTORY

By WILLIAM C. MOREY, Professor of History and Political Science,
University of Rochester


This course in ancient history, from the earliest times to Charlemagne,
meets fully the requirements of the College Entrance Examination Board,
and of the New York State Education Department. The same vital features
which have made the author’s Greek History and Roman History so
successful, have been retained in this book. The same topical method of
treatment, the same arrangement by paragraphs, the same simple, direct
style, and the same clear and graphic presentation, are among its chief
characteristics.

¶ The book indicates the historical relations of the various countries
to one another, and the contributions which each has made to the
progress of mankind. Throughout the author has aimed to develop in the
pupil’s mind a scientific spirit, by emphasizing the continuity of
history, and by making clear the relation of special facts to general
movements, the relation of these general movements to the growth of the
national character and institutions, and the relation of each nation’s
career to the general progress of mankind.

¶ The usual division of ancient history into Oriental, Greek, and
Roman has been followed, and great care has been taken in each case
to lay emphasis on those particular features which have distinguished
one nation from another, and which have given it the peculiar place it
holds in history.

¶ The important relation of geography to history has constantly been
kept in view. More than twenty progressive maps are given to show the
successive changes which took place in the development and decline
of the different nations. Each chapter is followed by a synopsis for
review, while at the end of the book there is a list of references for
reading.

NEW MEDIEVAL AND MODERN HISTORY

From Charlemagne to the Present Day

 By SAMUEL BANNISTER HARDING, Ph. D., Professor of European History,
 Indiana University.

 Based upon the author’s “Essentials in Mediaeval and Modern History,”
 prepared in consultation with ALBERT BUSHNELL HART, LL.D., Professor
 of History, Harvard University.


While based on the author’s previous Essentials in Mediaeval and Modern
History, in the present volume the plan has been so reorganized, the
scope so extended, and the matter so largely rewritten, that the result
is practically a new book. The present volume reflects the suggestions
of many teachers who have used the previous work in their classes.
The aim of this book has been to increase the emphasis on social,
industrial, and cultural topics and to enable the student to understand
modern conditions and tendencies.

¶ The narrative is brought fully up-to-date, including such recent
events as the British Parliament Act of 1911, the Italian-Turkish
War, and the Balkan War, 1912-1913. Each topic is made definite and
concrete, and such important subjects as the unification of Italy and
the unification of Germany are treated in separate chapters.

¶ The teaching apparatus has been made as useful as possible by the
arrangement and the typography of the text and by the addition of
chronological tables, lists of important dates, suggestive topics
and questions for the pupil to investigate, and brief directions for
general reading.

¶ Adequate illustrations and maps are inserted profusely throughout
the text. Variety and color are imparted to the narrative by frequent
quotations from the sources, and by striking characterizations from
modern works.

FOUNDATIONS OF GERMAN

 By C. F. KAYSER, Ph. D., Professor of German, Normal College of the
 City of New York; and F. MONTESER, Ph. D., Head of German Department,
 De Witt Clinton High School, New York.


This course reduces to a minimum all preparatory work, and introduces
the learner at the earliest possible moment to the literature of the
language. Among its distinctive features are:

I. It includes only topics absolutely essential for any progress
whatever, and it presents them as briefly as is consistent with perfect
clearness.

II. It makes large use of “the living grammar.” In this way it enlivens
instruction in grammar, stimulates self-activity, and develops the
feeling for correctness, which is the chief thing to be looked for in
all language study.

III. It lends itself excellently to conversational practice. The
vocabulary has been selected very carefully from everyday language,
and the phrases of the German exercises are all of a colloquial and
strictly idiomatic character. While primarily intended to illustrate
definite grammatical phenomena, their tone and language are so natural
that whole exercises may be turned into impromptu conversation, thus
combining drill in speaking and in grammar. This is still more true of
the connected readings, which are very simple.

IV. It offers a firm foundation on which a solid superstructure can be
erected. The lessons are steadily progressive; no attempt is made to
minimize difficulties at the beginning. The English exercises give the
pupil a chance to test his knowledge and power, while the exercises
in word formation stimulate his interest in the building up of his
vocabulary, which will be of great service in future sight reading.

FRANÇOIS’ ESSENTIALS OF FRENCH

By VICTOR E. FRANÇOIS, Ph.D., Associate Professor of French, College of
the City of New York.


A course for beginners, whose acquirement of a foreign language
is often hampered by an incomplete mastery of English grammar.
The development here proceeds from the known English form to the
unknown French form, with constant comparison and contrast of the
two languages. This system will tend to fortify students by forcing
them to notice and analyze the English as well as the French forms of
expression.

¶ The models precede the rules, the salient features being made
prominent by heavy type. The rules cover the necessary facts of the
language as simply and completely as possible, but the student is not
confused by masses of exceptions, peculiarities, and idioms rarely seen
and still more rarely used. The vocabulary, of moderate extent, is
composed of ordinary words likely to be used in everyday conversation,
and is increased slowly, care being taken to repeat the words again and
again in succeeding exercises.

¶ The first lessons have been made short and simple, in order to allow
for the initial difficulties. The exercises are composed of sentences
connected in sense so far as this is possible without detriment to the
application of the principles and repetition of words. Each lesson
includes generally four exercises: a review, a portion of French text,
a set of questions based on the text and usually followed by a grammar
drill, and an English exercise based entirely on the text and on the
rules developed in the lesson. Reading lessons are introduced at
intervals and may serve also as exercises in pronunciation, dictation,
conversation, or review of rules.

MILNE’S STANDARD ALGEBRA

By WILLIAM J. MILNE, Ph.D., LL.D., President of the New York State
Normal College, Albany, N. Y.


The Standard Algebra conforms to the most recent courses of study.
The inductive method of presentation is followed, but declarative
statements and observations are used, instead of questions. Added to
this kind of unfolding and development of the subject are illustrative
problems and explanations to bring out specific points, the whole being
driven home by varied and abundant practice.

¶ The problems are fresh in character, and besides the traditional
problems include a large number drawn from physics, geometry, and
commercial life. They are classified according to the nature of the
equations involved, not according to subject matter. The statement of
necessary definitions and of principles is clear and concise, but the
proofs of principles, except some important ones, are left for the
maturer years of the pupil.

¶ Accuracy and self-reliance are encouraged by the use of numerous
checks and tests, and by the requirement that results be verified.
The subject of graphs is treated after simple equations, introduced
by some of their simple uses in representing statistics, and in
picturing two related quantities in the process of change, and again
after quadratics. Later they are utilized in discussing the values of
quadratic expressions. Factoring receives particular attention. Not
only are the usual cases given fully and completely with plenty of
practice, but the factor theorem is taught.

¶ The helpful and frequent reviews are made up of pointed oral
questions, abstract exercises, problems, and recent college entrance
examination questions. The book is unusually handy in size and
convenient for the pocket. The page size is small.

PLANT LIFE AND PLANT USES

By JOHN GAYLORD COULTER, Ph. D.


An elementary textbook providing a foundation for the study of
agriculture, domestic science, or college botany. But it is more than a
textbook on botany--it is a book about the fundamentals of plant life
and about the relations between plants and man. It presents as fully
as is desirable for required courses in high schools those large facts
about plants which form the present basis of the science of botany.
Yet the treatment has in view preparation for life in general, and not
preparation for any particular kind of calling.

The subject is dealt with from the viewpoint of the pupil rather than
from that of the teacher or the scientist. The style is simple, clear,
and conversational, yet the method is distinctly scientific, and the
book has a cultural as well as a practical object.

The text has a unity of organization. So far as practicable the
familiar always precedes the unfamiliar in the sequence of topics, and
the facts are made to hang together in order that the pupil may see
relationships. Such topics as forestry, plant breeding, weeds, plant
enemies and diseases, plant culture, decorative plants, and economic
bacteria are discussed where most pertinent to the general theme
rather than in separate chapters which destroy the continuity. The
questions and suggestions which follow the chapters are of two kinds;
some are designed merely to serve as an aid in the study of the text,
while others suggest outside study and inquiry. The classified tables
of terms which precede the index are intended to serve the student
in review, and to be a general guide to the relative values of the
facts presented. More than 200 attractive illustrations, many of them
original, are included in the book.

ESSENTIALS OF BIOLOGY

 By GEORGE WILLIAM HUNTER, A. M., Head of Department of Biology, De
 Witt Clinton High School, New York City.


This new first-year course treats the subject of biology as a whole,
and meets the requirements of the leading colleges and associations
of science teachers. Instead of discussing plants, animals, and
man as separate forms of living organisms, it treats of life in
a comprehensive manner, and particularly in its relations to the
progress of humanity. Each main topic is introduced by a problem,
which the pupil is to solve by actual laboratory work. The text that
follows explains and illustrates the meaning of each problem. The
work throughout aims to have a human interest and a practical value,
and to provide the simplest and most easily comprehended method of
demonstration. At the end of each chapter are lists of references to
both elementary and advanced books for collateral reading.


SHARPE’S LABORATORY MANUAL IN BIOLOGY

In this Manual the 56 important problems of Hunter’s Essentials of
Biology are solved; that is, the principles of biology are developed
from the laboratory standpoint. It is a teacher’s detailed directions
put into print. It states the problems, and then tells what materials
and apparatus are necessary and how they are to be used, how to avoid
mistakes, and how to get at the facts when they are found. Following
each problem and its solution is a full list of references to other
books.

WEBSTER’S SECONDARY SCHOOL DICTIONARY


This new dictionary is based on Webster’s New International Dictionary,
and therefore conforms to the best present usage. It presents the
largest number of words and phrases ever included in a school
dictionary--all those, however new, likely to be needed by any pupil.
It is a reference book for the reader and a guide in the use of
English, both oral and written. It fills every requirement that can
reasonably be expected of a dictionary of moderate size.

¶ This new book gives the preference to forms of spelling now current
in the United States, in cases of doubt leaning toward the simpler
forms that may be coming into use. In the matter of pronunciation such
alternatives are included as are in very common use, but the one that
is preferred is clearly indicated. Each definition is in the form of a
specific statement accompanied by one or more synonyms, between which
careful discrimination is made.

¶ In addition, this dictionary includes an unusual amount of
supplementary information of value to students: the etymology,
syllabication and capitalization of words; many proper names from
folklore, mythology, and the Bible; a list of prefixes and suffixes;
all irregularly inflected forms; rules for spelling; 2329 lists of
synonyms, in which 3518 words are carefully discriminated; answers
to many questions on the use of correct English constantly asked by
pupils; a guide to pronunciation; abbreviations used in writing and
printing; a list of 1200 foreign words and phrases; a dictionary of
5400 proper names of persons and places, etc.

DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE TEXTBOOKS

Published Complete and in Sections


We issue a Catalogue of High School and College Textbooks, which we
have tried to make as valuable and as useful to teachers as possible.
In this catalogue are set forth briefly and clearly the scope and
leading characteristics of each of our best textbooks. In most cases
there are also given testimonials from well-known teachers, which have
been selected quite as much for their descriptive qualities as for
their value as commendations.

¶ For the convenience of teachers this Catalogue is also published in
separate sections treating of the various branches of study. These
pamphlets are entitled: English, Mathematics, History and Political
Science, Science, Modern Foreign Languages, Ancient Languages,
Commercial Subjects, and Philosophy and Education. A single pamphlet is
devoted to the Newest Books in all subjects.

¶ Teachers seeking the newest and best books for their classes are
invited to send for our Complete High School and College Catalogue, or
for such sections as may be of greatest interest.

¶ Copies of our price lists, or of special circulars, in which these
books are described at greater length than the space limitations of the
catalogue permit, will be mailed to any address on request.

¶ All correspondence should be addressed to the nearest of the
following offices of the company: New York, Cincinnati, Chicago,

        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
